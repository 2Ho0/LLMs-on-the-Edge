2;Which name is also used to describe the Amazon rainforest in English?;also known in English as Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle;"The Amazon Rainforest can also be referred to as Amazonia or Latin American Rain Forest. These names highlight different aspects of its vastness and significance within South America, with ""Amazon"" coming from the Amazon River which flows through it, while 'Latin American' emphasizes its location on the continent beyond just Brazil where this rainforest primarily lies.";56;12;10;7.061841726303101;14.4458;85.6
3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava);Igneous rocks are types of rocks formed directly by the cooling and solidification (crystallization) of molten lava or magma. They originate either on the surface as volcanic rocks, following an eruption that expels hot rock fragments into the air before they land back to Earth'thy crust alternatively, igneous rocks can form deep within the earth from magmas crystallizing beneath its surface resulting in plutonic or intrusive rocks. So essentially, an igneous rock is a rock formed through solidification of molten material (either lava on the Earth's crust if it erupts as volcanic activity and then cools at or above ground level or magma deep underground where slow cooling forms large crystals). The composition, texture, and classification depend largely upon how quickly this solidification occurs. Rapidly-cooled lava (on the surface) tends to form fine-grained rocks like basalt while slower cooled material below Earth's crust often results in medium grain sizes with visible crystals such as granite or gabbro, indicating a slow cooling process deep within.;164;10;7;19.532345294952393;14.647000000000002;91.0625
4;What is the largest city the Rhine runs through?;Cologne, Germany;"The Rhine River does not flow directly through a single ""city"" as it passes through various urban and rural areas, but among these places are some large cities. The section of the river often associated with significant European metropolises begins in Switzerland at Lake Constance (also known as Bodensee), flows into Germany where one major city is prominently situated along its banks: Cologne (Köln).

Cologne has a rich history and long association with the Rhine River, being an important cultural center for centuries. The river also passes through other cities such as Düsseldorf, Duisburg, and Dortmund before it finally empties into the North Sea in Rotterdam on its Dutch border side after flowing across several countries including France (Lyon), Switzerland, Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Netherlands along with their corresponding territories.

The largest city directly influenced by or situated alongside one of Europe's major rivers like Rhine is often subjective due to varying definitions such as geographical size versus population density however, Cologne stands out historically among the ones I mentioned above for its prominence in relation with this river segment within Germany.";182;9;2;18.912524461746216;14.686437500000002;92.8125
5;Along with geothermal and nuclear, what is a notable non-combustion heat source?;solar power;"Apart from geothermal and nuclear energy sources which do not rely on combustion to generate electricity or provide heating, another significant non-combustion heat source can be solar thermal power. This technology harnesses the sun'dicted temperature differences by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large amount of sunlight onto an absorber that converts it into heat energy which is then used for producing electricity typically through steam turbines, similar in some ways to conventional fossil fuel-based power plants but without combustion and with far less environmental impact.

Here are other notable non-combustion (or at least low carbon footprint) sources:

1. **Wind Energy** - Wind energy is harnessed using wind turbines that convert kinetic energy from the wind into electrical power without combusting fossil fuels or relying on a heat source like geothermal systems do with Earth's internal temperatures, and solar thermal collectors use sunlight to produce steam.
   
2. **Hydroelectric Power** - This involves capturing energy from flowing water in rivers or dams where the movement of water through turbines generates electricity without combustion although it doesn't directly provide heat, hydro plants are often used alongside geothermal facilities which do produce steam for power generation.
   
3. **Tidal Power** - Similar to wind energy but using tidal movements caused by the gravitational pull of the moon and sun on Earth’s waters again there is no combustion involved in generating electricity from this natural, rhythmic source.
  
4. **Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture (BECCS)** - Technologies here involve burning biomass such as wood pellets or agricultural residues for energy production however, the CO2 released during combustion is captured and stored underground to reduce its impact on climate change—aiming toward negative emissions.
   
5. **Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)** - It utilizes temperature differences in ocean water at various depths cooler deep seawater, heated by sunlight-warmed surface waters is used to drive a heat engine which produces electricity without combustion or significant greenhouse gas emissions.
   
6. **Microwave Energy Conversion** - This cutting-edge field involves using microwaves generated outside of the human body, such as those produced by space satellites and mobile phones to generate electrical power though experimental at this stage with a vast potential for future noncombustion energy generation methods.
   
7. **Electrochemical Cells** - Such systems convert chemical energy directly into electricity through reactions, similar in principle to batteries but on an industrial scale and without combustion (e.g., flow battery technology). 

While solar thermal power is a direct non-combustional heat source for conversion of sunlight into usable forms of energy like steam or hot water heating systems that are used independently, it's often coupled with photovoltaic cells which convert light directly to electricity. Similarly other renewables operate without burning fuels and can contribute significantly towards a clean power grid when integrated effectively alongside each other as part of an overall sustainable energy strategy for heat generation or electrical production.";474;12;2;56.23126721382141;14.697061224489795;94.95918367346938
6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;"The fundamental theorem that highlights the central importance of prime numbers in number theory is not a single ""theorem"" but rather two related results: Euclid's Theorem and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Here are brief explanations for each as they relate to primes:

1. **Euclid’sinque** (as it relates mainly to prime numbers): 
   - The most famous result about primes is a simple yet powerful statement by Euclid that there are infinitely many prime numbers, which means no matter how large the number you list of all known primes, one can always find another. This highlights their infinite nature and central place in mathematics as they serve as building blocks for other integers through multiplication (factorization).
   
2. **The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**: 
   - More specifically, this theorem states that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime itself or can be uniquely factored into primes up to the order of these factors in simpler terms, it says there's one and only one way (up to rearranging) to break down any given number into its constituent irreducible elements. Primes are essential here because they serve as those indivisible building blocks from which all other numbers can be constructed through their multiplication alone—a property known as unique factorization of integers, without prime factors beyond a certain point (for composite numbers).
   
While these results don't define the role in every aspect of number theory related to primes – there are many facets and consequences that stem from them – they lay down foundational principles upon which much else is built. Understanding primality within factorization, divisibility tests, or properties like prime gaps further explores their significance but traces back fundamentally to Euclid's insights about the infinitude of primes and unique decomposition into these building blocks through fundamental arithmetic.";294;11;5;31.278612852096558;14.679185185185187;88.88888888888889

8;What is the second most abundant element?;helium;The second most abundant element in the Earth's crust and mantle, after oxygen, is silicon. Silicon makes up a significant portion of rocks by weight (approximately one-quarter), primarily found as part of minerals like quartz where it combines with oxygen to form silica tetrahedra in the crystal lattice structure. In its pure elemental form and not bonded within compounds, free silicon is relatively rare on Earth's surface but can be produced artificially or extracted from certain types of metal ore concentrates like bauxite (which contains aluminum oxides). When considering all elements combined in the earth’s crust – including those present deep underground and dissolved within seawater, silicon still holds its position as one of the most prevalent elements.;118;7;1;13.684208869934082;14.778363636363634;93.54545454545455
9;What popular term is another commonly used way of saying the Amazon?;Amazonia or the Amazon Jungle;"Another popular term for the Amazon Rainforest or Amazon Basin is ""The Lungs of the Earth.""

10;What is the worlds largest academic and private library system?;Harvard Library;"Determining which institution holds the title for the ""world'supreme"" or largest combined academic and private library collection can be complex due to various definitions of what constitutes a significant partof such systems, but one notable contender that often comes up in discussions is Stanford University Libraries. Here are some key points regarding large-scale university libraries:

1. **Stanford University Library System** - It includes multiple library locations with vast collections and extensive digital resources integrated into the California Digital Library (CALiP), which encompasses more than just its own campus holdings, reaching a substantial audience beyond Stanford alone. 

2. **University of Oxford Bodleian Libraries** - With historical roots dating back to Thomas Bodle's bequest in the early 15th century and significant growth over time, these libraries are extensive both academically (with thousands upon thousands of volumes) as well as privately through their specialized collections.

3. **Harvard University Libraries** - As one component of Harvard College Library system with millions of items in print or microform covering virtually every subject area and numerous private holdings, including the Widener Library which has a significant collection for research purposes as well as being used by students at Cambridge (one aspect that makes it quite extensive).

4. **British Library** - Although not affiliated with any particular university in England or Scotland where most of its collections are housed and primarily public, the British Library holds millions upon millions of items from all around the world including rare manuscripts like Beowulf (one reason for their claim to extensive holdings).

5. **University libraries often have significant private collection elements** - These may consist of personal or corporate collections donated over time that are integrated with academic resources, providing both scholarly materials and items not typically found in public library systems – such as the Boston Athenaeum's rare books which combine a traditional role for an independent learned society’s libraries.

If by ""private"" you mean privately owned collections outside of universities (like those at large private institutions or families), there are significant ones like The New York Public Library system, although its scope is different in nature compared to academic university systems and it includes many public community resources beyond just the holdings from one institution.

For a precise current assessment on which library has by far more combined collections (academic plus private if relevant), you might need specific criteria for what constitutes ""largest"" – such as volume counts, collection diversity or breadth of subjects covered - and it's also dynamic with new donations occurring all the time. University libraries worldwide are often continuously expanding their holdings to support teaching, research, and community engagement effectively.";436;10;2;45.671485900878906;14.717475000000002;92.0
11;Which Florida city has the biggest population?;Jacksonville;The largest city by population in Florida is Miami. According to estimates from various sources, including U.S. Census Bureau data and local government records as of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, Miami had an estimated population within its metropolitan area ranging between approximately 6 million people, making it one of the most populous cities not just in Florida but also across all states outside Texas. The city's high population density is due to a combination of factors including tourism, international business presence, and immigration from other countries. Please note that for official statistics or precise figures, I recommend consulting current data directly from reliable sources such as the latest U.S. Census Bureau releases or local government databases.;119;7;1;11.98605465888977;14.75711111111111;93.88888888888889
12;What percentage of global assets does the richest 1% of people have?;40%;"The wealth distribution worldwide is vastly unequal, and various estimates suggest that the richest 1% of individuals hold a significant portion of total global assets. According to reports from organizations such as Oxfam International and Credit Suisse, it's often cited that approximately 50-60% of the planet’thy wealth is owned by this small fraction. However, these figures can fluctuate with changing economic conditions, new data collection methods, or different definitions used to measure global assets.

For up-to-date statistics and precise calculations regarding what percentage of worldly assets are held by the richest 1%, please refer to recent research studies from credible financial analysis groups or consult current publications on wealth inequality that might offer a more refined understanding based on contemporary data sets, which may have been updated since my knowledge was cut off.

Here's an attempt at answering your question with general estimates: As of the last reports available before my 2023 knowledge limit:

- According to Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Report (released in October 2021), as I do not have real-time data, we might consider that around half or more than this figure – close to two thirds of the world's wealth is held by just one percent. This report highlighted significant disparities and a concentration among ultrahigh net worth individuals (UHNWIs).
  
As these numbers are subject to change, it’s advisable always to look for current data sources if you need up-to-date information on global wealth distribution. 

Remember that understanding the dynamics of economic inequality also requires considering factors such as how and when this concentration develops over time who is entering into these positions economically (through inheritance, education accessibility, etc.) – which may not be directly measurable through static reports alone but can provide context to interpret wealth distribution data.";292;12;1;31.259094715118408;14.707222222222219;95.11111111111111
13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France;"The French Huguenots, who were members of the Reformed Church of France and adherents to Calvinist doctrine in a predominantly Catholic country during the 16th and 17th centuries, had significant populations concentrated primarily along major trade routes as well as various regions where religious tolerance was more accepted or they sought safety from persecution.

During times of heightened conflict known as the French Wars of Religion (between Catholics and Protestants), Huguenots found themselves particularly vulnerable in certain areas:

1. **Île-de-France** – This includes Paris, which was a central cultural hub but also experienced religious strife leading to periodic persecution for its minority populations including the Huguenots. 
2. **Normandy and Brittany** - These regions were home to substantial Protestant communities due in part to relative tolerance under local rulers such as Henry IV of Navarre, who was himself a convert from Catholicism before becoming King of France (and initially promoting religious conciliation).
3. **The Pays de la Loire region** – Particularly cities like La Rochelle were centers for Huguenot culture and trade due to their strong naval presence on the Atlantic Ocean, which provided both economic opportunity as well as a degree of isolation from central authorities that often imposed stricter religious conformity.
4. **The southern Rhône Valley** – This area saw significant Protestant activity partly because it was further removed geographically and culturally from Paris where Catholic influence had been stronger, allowing for more diverse beliefs to thrive there historically under different rulerships before the Edict of Nantes' revocation.
5. **The Loire Valley** – This region also supported a Huguenot presence that was integral in local commerce and culture until their rights were increasingly curtailed as political climates shifted toward Catholic uniformity within France’s borders under monarchical rule, particularly during the reign of Louis XIV with his revocation edict.
6. **The Swiss Cantons** – While not located on French soil directly, Switzerland was a haven for many fleeing persecution due to its historical religious tolerance and where Protestantism had been established centuries earlier thus becoming an important center outside France itself but inextricably linked with Huguenot history.
7. **Calvinist strongholds abroad** – Aside from internal regions, there were also significant concentrations of French Calvinists who sought refuge across Europe and beyond to countries like the Dutch Republic (the Netherlands), where many established themselves during times when France was hostile toward Protestantism within its own borders due to religious wars.

In summary, Huguenot populations in France had a degree of mobility as they often relocated following periods of persecution or economic opportunity however, regions like Île-de-France and areas around the Loire Valley were notable hubs for these communities before their eventual dispersal due to revocation acts such as those by Louis XIV. After fleeing France during the Revocation Edict (1685), many Huguenots sought new lives in countries like Switzerland, Belgium, Spain and England where they contributed significantly until religious tolerance practices eventually allowed them a degree of integration into wider society or continued self-segregation within their own communities.";497;7;7;55.84738230705261;14.732897959183669;92.59183673469387
14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;"Ctenophora, commonly known as comb jellies, are a phylum of marine invertebrates characterized by their gelatinous bodies and unique mode of locomotion. They belong to the animal kingdom and inhabit both shallow waters and depths down to several thousand meters below sea level. Here's some information about them:

1. Anatomy: Ctenophores have a simple body structure that typically consists of two layers – an outer epidermis (epithelial layer) made up mostly of cnidocytes and tentacles, as well as internal gastrovascular systems such as the stomach or gut. The entire organism is transparent except for its distinctive rows of fused pigment cells called chromatophores that help them camoufilate with their surroundings.

2. Size: They come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from mere millimeters to several inches wide or longer depending on the species some large comb jellies can be over an arm's length long! Their body structure is often circular-shaped but occasionally elongated as well for certain types of ctenophores.

3. Comb rows: Ctenophores have eight to sixteen sets of fused, hollow tentacle plates called 'ctenes', which are used in locomotion and feeding purposes - each set arranged along the body column from mouth or pedal disc downwards towards their anus on top-most end. These rows move with a rhythmic wave motion to create propulsion through water, resembling caterpillar's movement by coordinating contractions of muscles within these tentacle plates (or 'ctenes').

4. Feeding: Ctenophores are carnivorous and feed mainly on zooplankton such as copepods or jellyfish larvae but can also consume other small marine animals, fish eggs, tiny crustaceans like amphipods (or pencil clams), and sometimes even microscopic algae. They have specialized cells called 'choanocytes' that help filter water around the mouth to trap prey before ingesting it via pharynx muscles within their gut walls through rapid expulsions of cilia, enabling efficient digestion - they can consume upwards of 30% body weight per day!

5. Reproduction: Most species reproduce sexually with separate male and female individuals while some hermaphroditic ones have both types present in one individual (hermispheres). When gametes are mature, ctenophorans release them into the surrounding water where fertilization occurs externally later on developing embryos grow within gelatinous masses until they emerge as free-swimming larvae.

6. Environment: Ctenophora is found worldwide but prefers warm or temperate waters, living close to shorelines and reefs where abundant food sources (smaller fishes/zooplankton) can be obtained easily - some species are even parasites! They have also been observed in colder environments like the deep sea down to 100 meters depth.

7. Threats: Recently, there has been concern regarding their increasing populations due partly from human-induced overfishing this may lead them into predation on commercially important fish species (like juvenile herring) as well – causing disruption in marine food chains and economic losses for commercial industries.

In conclusion, ctenophores are fascinating gelatinous creatures with unique body structures that help propel themselves using their comb-shaped tentacles while catching prey through filtering water they play important roles within the ecosystem but must be carefully managed to prevent further imbalance of marine life.";507;4;8;65.01324558258057;14.771140350877188;94.03508771929825

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;"Imperialism has historically been administered through various methods, which often reflect the prevailing attitudes and technologies of the time. Here are some typical ways that empires have maintained control over their colonies or territories:

1. **Military Conquest**: The initial establishment of an imperial presence has frequently involved military force to subdue local populations, suppress resistance movements, and secure strategic locations for further expansion.

2. **Colonial Governors/Administrators**: High-ranking officials or commissioners from the home country were appointed by colonial powers as governors with broad authority over native affairs often without significant input from indigenous leaders. These administrations would enforce laws, collect taxes and maintain order according to imperial priorities rather than local needs.

3. **Indirect Rule**: In some cases—particularly in Africa by the British Empire during certain periods (e.g., Nigeria under Lord Lugard's ""indirect rule"")—local rulers were kept on their thrones but given limited powers and authority, acting as puppets controlled through a colonial administration that would relay decisions to them from above.

4. **Direct Rule**: In regions with no local traditional leadership or where direct control was deemed more effective (like French West Africa), colonies were governed directly by officials appointed by the metropole, establishing legal and administrative systems based on European models without significant adaptation for indigenous societal structures.

5. **Economic Exploitation**: The extraction of resources was often enforced through economic policies that benefited colonial powers financially while exploiting local labor markets, agriculture, natural wealth (e.g., minerals), and other productive endeavors to the detrsileation at native populations' expense without fair compensation or development benefits for them in return.

6. **Cultural Domination**: Imperial powers often sought not just political control but cultural dominance, which included spreading their language (as a lingua franca), religion ('civilizing mission'), and values through education systems that were aligned with colonial ideologies rather than local traditions or knowledge bases.

7. **Infrastructure Development**: The construction of infrastructure like railways was often geared to benefit the extraction industries (e.g., mining, agriculture), which could serve both as tools for economic exploitation and means to consolidate control by integrating different parts of an empire more effectively with its core territories or country-of-origin nation.

8. **Legislation**: Impositions such as laws were enacted that restricted the political rights, land ownership opportunities for locals (e.g., denying them representation in colonial legislatures), and could include racial discrimination policies to create a clear hierarchy between colonizers/native populations.

9. **Propaganda**: Information disseminated by imperial agents sought not just information control but also shaping public opinion within the colony, often highlighting benevolence of colonial rulers while downplaying or distorting negative aspects and promoting loyalty to the empire over local interests.

10. **Strategic Dependencies**: Building up certain industries (such as military installations) created economic dependencies which made it difficult for colonies to become independent economically, often resulting in neocolonialism where control is maintained through political and financial leverage rather than outright occupation or governance structures.

These methods were not universally applied across all imperialist endeavors but represented common strategies used by various empires throughout history such as the British Empire's colonial policies, which can differ greatly from one territory to another based on local dynamics and historical contexts. After World War II, a wave of decolonization led many former colonies towards independence with varying degrees of transitional governance structures that often addressed some aspects or legacies left by imperial administration methods but did not fully dismantle the deeply ingrained inequalities established during colonial rule.";566;7;8;68.42439246177673;14.756016666666666;93.35
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"The development and acceptance of improvements or modifications concerning Sir Isaac Newton's Laws of Motion didn't occur over a span as if in an experiment with clear start and end points. Instead, the refinement of our understanding has been gradual through centuries marked by contributions from various scientists who built upon classical mechanics to develop more advanced theories such as Einstein's Theory of Relativity when dealing with high velocities or strong gravitational fields where Newtonian physics falls short.

Here is a brief timeline highlighting key moments:

- 1687 – Isaac Newton published his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which laid out the Laws of Motion as well as Universal Gravitation. These laws formed the basis for classical mechanics and were widely accepted without major challenge until around the early 20th century when they started to be tested under extreme conditions (high speed or strong gravity).
  
- Early 1900s – Scientists like Hendrik Lorentz, Hermann Minkowski, and others began making slight refinements for specific contextual situations. For instance, in high velocity scenarios such as those encountered with electromagnetic waves at the turn of century, which led to advancements beyond Newtonian physics but did not yet displace it entirely because these were mostly special relativistic effects that didn't significantly affect everyday life and classical mechanics still applied well enough for most practical purposes.
  
- 1905 – Albert Einstein published his paper on Special Relativity, which included modifications to Newtonian physics when dealing with objects moving at speeds close to the speed of light (approximately \(3 \times 10^8\) meters per second). Although it didn't replace classical mechanics entirely for all cases due to its limited scope relative to non-relativistic conditions, Special Relativity became crucial in modern physics.
  
- In 1915 – Einstein published his General Theory of Relavity which further refined the understanding by taking into account objects moving at a significant fraction of light speed or within strong gravitational fields where Newton's laws were found to be insu each situation, and this redefined concepts like gravity itself.
  
- Subsequent years – Many physicists continued researching these areas: quantum mechanics emerged as an understanding that classical physics did not explain phenomena at the atomic scale or under extreme gravitational conditions further advancements in cosmology shed light on dark matter, and energy which Newtonian concepts could neither account for nor predict.
  
- Present day – Classical Mechanics remains a fundamental part of modern education because it works well within its domain (low velocities and weak gravity), but we understand that at certain thresholds or extreme environments like near black holes where General Relativity becomes significant, Newton's Laws are no longer sufficient.
  
Thus the idea isn’t so much about ""improving"" on a timeline as it is an evolving understanding of physical laws across various scales and conditions with continuous contributions from many researchers over centuries leading up to our current day knowledge which acknowledges both Newtonian mechanics for everyday-scale phenomena, while incorporating modern physics where classical theories are inadequate.

The 'improvement' on the understanding of motion has been a paradigm shift rather than incremental steps along an explicit timeline and involves integration with other theoretical frameworks like quantum theory to fully describe how objects move under all circumstances today.";533;14;4;58.16306686401367;14.733294117647057;93.19607843137256
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"Islamism is a political ideology that seeks to implement certain principles derived from Islam in public and private spheres. Here are some key areas where elements or strands within Islamism may aim to have influence:

1. Governance and Law – Many forms of Islamism advocate for governance based on Sharia (Islamic law), which includes various aspects like civil, criminal justice systems, family laws, inheritance rules, etc., tailored according to their interpretation of religious texts such as the Quran and Hadiths.

2. Society – This can include efforts towards creating a community structure that is closely aligned with Islamist principles where social norms are influenced by religion, including gender roles, education systems (which may incorporate Religious Studies), dress codes like hijabs for women in some contexts, etc.

3. Economy and Finance – Some movements within Islamism promote economic models based on Sharia-compliant financial practices such as prohibiting interest (usury or ushur) while promoting profit sharing arrangements akin to the Islamic finance concept of Mudarabah, which is an investment partnership.

4. Education – Influence may be seen in school curriculums and higher education institutions where religious studies are emphasized alongside conventional subjects some movements aim for complete integration or establishment of Madrassas (Islamic educational institutes).

5. Public Life – Rituals, celebrations like Ramadan observance with increased public devotion activities during the holy month can be seen as forms of integrating Islamism into daily life events and festivals within society at large. 

6. Political Action – Groups may seek political power to enact their agenda or influence existing government policies through lobbying, voting in elections (when allowed), civil discourse on public platforms such as talk shows etc., aligning politics with religious convictions and principles of Islamism.

It's essential to note that the term ""Islamism"" encompasses a broad range of ideologies from relatively moderate positions advocating for social justice within an existing political framework, like certain wings in Egyptian/Palestinian politics represented by Hamas or Hezbollah through extreme forms such as militant extremist groups including ISIS and Al-Qaeda. The actual scope can vary significantly based on the specific group's interpretation of Islamism.";348;11;4;40.52933931350708;14.705000000000002;93.2
20;When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?;Following a referendum in 1997;"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, there isn't a specific date I can provide for when Parliament (also known as Holyrood) of Scotland last met. The Scottish Parliament usually sits throughout each session year from October to May, with an additional meeting or ""pre-sessional period"" at the start and end where planning takes place outside these official sitting periods.

For precise information regarding schedules including dates when parliamentary sessions are convened—or if there have been any recent sittings I may not be aware of due to my last update being from early 2023—it's best to check the latest updates directly through Parliament’s official resources or contact their offices.

Remember that in Scotland, decisions and activities within parliament are influenced by factors like political will, upcoming elections (Scotland holds its own referendum every five years for devolution matters), and external events such as a pandemic which could affect session timings significantly due to health guidelines or social distancing requirements.

21;The immune system protects organisms against what?;disease;"The immune system primarily defends an organism against pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. These are microorganisms that can cause infections or diseases. The immune response involves a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs working together to identify and neutralize these foreign invaders:

1. Inflammatdependent pathogens trigger the recruitment of white blood cells (leukocytes) from circulation into infected or damaged areas in an effort to eliminate them through phagocytosis, release antimicrobial substances and stimulate tissue repair processes.
2. Antibody-mediated immune responses target specific pathogens using specialized white blood cells called B lymphocytes (B cells). These produce proteins known as antibodies that bind to the invading microorganisms, neutralizing them or marking for destruction by other components of the immune system.
3. Cell-mediated responses involve T cells recognizing and killing infected host cells directly in certain cases – such as viruses replicating inside these cells - while also orchestrating a wider defensive response with help from helper (Th) or suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tregs).
4. The immune system can remember past invaders through memory B and T cells, which allow it to mount faster responses upon reinfection by the same pathogen – this underpins vaccinations’ effectiveness in preventing diseases like measles or influenza. 
5. Complementary proteins act as natural 'killer' elements that can punch holes into bacterial membranes, causing them to burst and die off—a process called lysis by complement activation pathway of immunity which is a significant aspect in the defense against microbial invaders.
6. The gut mucosal system also plays an important role as it contains specialized white blood cells that protect the body from enteric (intestinal) bacteria and parasites, serving both local protection at this entry point for many pathogens and contributing to overall immune surveillance of potential threats.
7. In more complex organisms like humans, additional barriers exist such as antimicrobial peptides in sweat or breast milk that can directly kill microbes before they even reach the internal environment where other immune components are at work. 
   
In summary, while these mechanisms have evolved to primarily target infectious agents and contribute towards maintaining healthy homeostasis within organisms, it is important for a balanced function of such defenses that an individual's microbiome (comprising harmless or beneficial bacteria) remains intact. Disruptions in this balance can sometimes lead to overactive immune responses causing autoimmune diseases where the body mistakenly attacks its own cells—further emphasizing how finely balanced and complex these defensive systems really are!";404;7;1;50.67559814453125;14.726454545454544;93.11363636363636
22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;"The term ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires,"" also known as centimillionaires, refers to individuals who have a net worth exceeding one hundred million dollars (USD). Since wealth is not static and varies over time due to economic conditions, personal investments, business performance, etc., the exact combined value of these 10 million dollar millionaires' assets in any given year like 2008 would require specific data that might be tracked by financial institutions or reports such as Forbes.

As my knowledge is up to date only until early 2023, I can provide general information: In the United States during and after the Great Recession of 2007-2009—which included 2008 at its peak—many people's net worth declined due to market turmoil. However, it is also known that some individuals continued or even increased their wealth despite these challenging times.

To find out the combined wealth of ""10 Million Dollar millionaires"" in 2008 specifically, one would typically refer to financial reports from credible sources like Forbes' lists for that year which track billionaire and centimillionarian statuses based on publicly available information. These resources often provide detailed analysis but might not always have the precise combined total due to complexities in asset valuation over time.

Please consult such a report or database, if possible:
- Forbes' list of U.S.-based billionaires and centimillionaries for that specific year would be an excellent place to start researching their wealth during 2008 specifically before the Great Recession significantly impacted asset values globally. Keep in mind though even then, actual combined total value may not account perfectly due to constant changes throughout each day of trading and fluctuating market conditions.
- The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) might have historical data regarding personal income which can be used as a proxy for high net worth individuals' wealth over time but it would still provide only estimates or trends rather than exact figures, especially at the centimillionary level of analysis.";317;14;3;35.91703224182129;14.684870967741935;92.6774193548387
23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973;The 1973 oil crisis began on October 6, when members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) proclaimed an oil embargo. The embargo was targeted primarily at nations perceived as supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War – namely, the United States and its allies in Europe and Japan. Prices for crude petroleum surged globally due to this action by Arab countries which cut production significantly or ceased exports altogether while demand continued unabated, leading up until March 1974 when OAPEC lifted restrictions on oil sales except those imposed as punishment against the embargoed nations.;97;7;2;11.374681234359741;14.692888888888888;90.33333333333333
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries;"The term ""Norman"" typically refers to the settlers from northern France who, under their leader Rollo, established themselves in what became known as Normandy. The granting of lands by French King Charles III the Simple at the end of the Viking invasions was signed on Christmas Day in the year 911 AD with a treaty often referred to as the ""Oaths of Strasbourg."" Thus, it is from around this time that what we know today as Normandy began forming under Norman control.

The Duchy of Normandy continued independently until its invasion by Philip II Augustus of France in 1204 AD and subsequently annexation into the French crown territory after his victory at the Battle of Bouvines, although a portion known as Lower Normandy was lost earlier to England under William I (the Conqueror) with conquests that culminated around Hastings in 1066.

Therefore, while Rollo began settling and establishing control over parts of what would become Normandy roughly at the start of the year 912 AD following his agreement on Christmas Day (ending one era), Norman influence solidified into a distinct cultural entity throughout subsequent centuries with its unique mix of Frankish governance systems alongside Norse elements.";196;6;4;21.023550033569336;14.74372222222222;85.94444444444444
25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;"When individuals or groups within a society rise up and challenge laws that they perceive as unjust, this action can be referred to as civil disobedience. Civil disobedience involves the peaceful violation of specific legal norms, often with the intention of drawing attention to their injustice and prompting social change or legislative reform. This form of protest has a long history dating back centuries and is associated with many significant societal movements for equality and justice around the world.

Here are some notable examples:

1. The American civil rights movement, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., used nonviolent resistance to challenge racial segregation laws in the United States during the 1950s and '60s. They organized boycotts, sit-ins at restaurants or places of entertainment which were deemed discriminatory, marches that highlighted systemic racism these acts drew national attention to racial inequality within America'dict laws (like Jim Crow).
   
2. The Indian independence movement: Gandhi advocated for civil disobedience as a way to oppose British rule in India and was instrumental during the Salt March, which aimed at protesting against an unfair salt tax imposed by Britain on Indians. This nonviolent resistance eventually led India towards its freedom from colonial power.
   
3. The Suffragette movement: Women who demanded their right to vote faced legal restrictions that they considered unjust and oppressive, so some took part in civil disobedience actions such as illegal protests or occupations of public spaces (like Parliament Square). Their efforts played a crucial role in the eventual granting of voting rights for women.
   
4. Civil Rights Movement: Inspired by Gandhi' s nonviolent resistance, figures like Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus as part of civil disobedience against racially biased laws enacted in the United States during segregation era sparking widespread protest and eventually leading towards changes.
   
5. Anti-apartheid movement: In South Africa, activists used various forms of resistance including boycotts to challenge apartheid policies until they were abolished entirely - a prime example where civil disobedience played an essential role in societal change over many years and led directly towards the end of racial segregation.
   
While these acts may violate specific laws, their purpose is not necessarily rebellion against governance but to highlight systemic inequality or unjust legislation with a view toward legal reform – hence civil disobedience should be distinguished from anarchism and other anti-government ideologies. Not all actions of protest are considered acts of legitimate dissent they must generally adhere to principles of nonviolence, direct action against specific laws or policies rather than broadly challenging societal institutions as a whole (like in revolutionary situations), while also aimed at constructive change and not merely disruption.
   
Remember that the context can significantly affect interpretation: what is seen as civil disobedience may be viewed differently, based on cultural norms or individual perception of lawfulness for instance, some might argue such acts constitute illegal protest while others view them necessary resistance against oppression and discrimination. The line between legitimate dissent (like peacefully challenging laws seen as unjust) versus more radical forms can sometimes be blurry but the principle at heart – to bring about change for a perceived greater good - remains constant across these examples of civil disobedience throughout history

26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;"The main sources of primary law in a legal system typically include:

1. **Constitutions** - The foundational or supreme laws that establish and govern institutions, principles, policies, rights (civil liberties), obligations, procedures for making amendments to the Constitution itself—and occasionally provide penalties against violation of its provisions. In some jurisdictions, a written constitution is explicitly recognized as primary law whereas in others it operates without being formally codified but nonetheless has significant authority due to precedent and interpretation by courts (especially supreme or highest court).

2. **Statutes/Legislation** - These are laws passed directly through legislative bodies such as parliaments, congresses, councils of states, etc., for a specific purpose that must be adhered to within the framework established by primary law (usually constitutional limitations on government power).

3. **Regulations/By-Laws** - These are secondary laws created and enacted through delegated legislation under powers granted in statutes, often involving detailed instructions necessary for their implementation which must align with higher authority of the Constitution or Legislative Acts (e.g., European Union directives converted into national law by member states).

4. **Case Law/Judicial Precedents** - Particularly within common law systems where past judicial decisions establish precedent that future cases must follow under principles like stare decisis, contributing to a body of interpretive and doctrinal development alongside statutes or legislation which are primary sources.

5. **International Law (Optional)** - Although not always binding domestic law as its application can be subjected to national constitutional provisions concerning international treaties' ratification process, agreements such as the Charter of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms may provide additional legal frameworks influencing primary laws where appropriate.

6. **Equity (Optional)** - Developing primarily within certain jurisdictions like England from principles aiming to mitigate injustice not adequately addressed by common law or statute, it's a source of secondary but influential case-based legal reasoning with its own body of precedent and doctrines.

In some systems, these sources might have different degrees of hierarchy for instance, constitutional provisions generally take primacy over ordinary legislation in most jurisdictions when there is conflict between the two according to their respective laws on statutory interpretation (like ""lex superior lex inferior non confit.""). Understanding primary law's main source involves looking into specific legal traditions and systems since different countries may emphasize certain sources differently.";375;8;5;44.53609800338745;14.715333333333332;95.61538461538461
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;"The Black Death, one of history's most devastating pandemics, is widely believed to have originated in Asia. The bacterium responsible for this catastrophic event, Yersinia pestis, likely emerged among rodent populations near China and then was transmitted along trade routes via the fleas carried by black rats on merchant ships traveling between Europe and Asia during that era.

In particular, historical evidence suggests an outbreak in the port city of Kaffa (present-thy Feodosia), located at present day Ukraine, around 1347 AD when Genoese traders were attacked by plague-infested rats while docked there under siege conditions. The crumbling walls allowed these infected rodents to scurry into the city and spread among humans via fleas bites or inhalation of droplets, triggering an outbreak that rapidly swept through Europe as merchants continued their journeys back home with this newfound illness.

While Asia is often cited for its origins, it's essential to remember the interconnected nature of trade routes and human societies across continents during medieval times – contributing significantly towards widespread dissemination like in Europe where approximately 30-60% mortality rate became a reality. This deadly combination led to massive upheavals not only demographically but also culturally, economically and politically within various regions affected by the Black Death over subsequent decades.

28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching;"Paul Baran developed the packet switching technology, which is a fundamental concept behind modern computer networking. He was an electrical engineer who introduced this idea in the late 1950s while working for RAND Corporation as part of his research on creating efficient and robust communication systems that could survive substantial damage from nuclear attacks during the Cold War era. Baran's work laid critical groundwork, eventually leading to technologies used today such as packet-switched networks which form the basis of internet connectivity including LAN (Local Area Network), MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching) and Internet Protocol (IP).

In addition to his significant contributions in network design concepts, Paul Baran also made advanc extradition systems. Specifically he worked on a technology for remote switching of circuits called Remote Circuit-Switched Access Systems (RCSS), which was designed with the goal of improving communication reliability and efficiency by eliminating unnecessary connections between switches in telecommunication networks—a precursor to today's packet routing protocol.
 
Lastly, Baran played a significant role as an educator he served on faculty at several universities where his innovative ideas helped shape the course of computer science and networking curriculum by introducing concepts like network robustness into academic discussion—concept that continues to influence modern computing education. His contributions have earned him recognition in technology circles, including inducteeships into prestigious organizations such as IEEE Communications Society’s Harold W. Goitein Memorial Award for his outstanding career and the Marconi Foundation's International Leadership Medal which acknowledges exceptional senior leadership achievements to promote communication sciences globally.";247;5;10;27.3151216506958;14.735782608695647;95.04347826086956
29;When was the French and Indian War?;1754?1763;The French and Indian War primarily took place between 1754 and 1thy, culminating in the Treaty of Paris which ended the conflict. It should be noted that while this war started relatively early in what we define as modern times for a battle setting (early to mid-18th century), it set the stage for future American conflicts including those leading up to the American Revolutionary War, and its impact was felt well beyond these dates due to political changes arising from Britain'sinvincive following.;82;7;1;9.080789804458618;14.717714285714283;95.85714285714286
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;"The components of pathogens (such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites) that are recognized by the immune system primarily include:

1. Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs): These molecules can be unique to microbes or shared among different types of pathogens—examples being bacterial lipopolysaccharides, flagellin proteins from motile organisms like certain parasites and bacteria, peptidoglycans in the cell walls of many Gram-positive bacteria, unmethylated CpG islands present mostly in microbial DNA but rarely in vertebrate genomes.

2. Danger or Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs): These are host biomolecules that can be released during cellular injury as a result of immune system activation, tissue damage from the pathogens themselves, inflammation due to infection, etc., such as heat shock proteins and extracellthyrocyte matrix molecules like hyaluronan fragments.

These PAMPs/DAMPs are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on or within immune cells that help orchestrate an effective, targeted response to infections while maintaining tolerance towards the host'dictory tissue and commensal microbiota. Examples of PRR types include Toll-like Receptors (TLRs), C-type Connexin channels (CXCR4/CCL5) that are present on immune cells, NOD-, CYBB-Related Family with Leukotriene Biosynthetic Potential or Cytokinogenic Activities in the Nuclear Factor of INflammation Regulatory factor (NOD1), and Toll-like Receptor Molecules.
  
It is important to note that, while this answer covers main components recognized by immune system against pathogens/damage induced molecular patterns within cells or on their surfaces which initiate the defense mechanisms, there are more specifics in complex interactions between these agents and various elements of our innate as well as adaptive arm. For example:
  - The complement system can be activated by both PAMP recognition (classical pathway) and DAMP binding to its receptors on immune cells. It helps opsonize invading organisms for phagocytosis, directly kill some types of bacteria through the formation of membrane-disrupting complexes known as Membrane Attack Complexes (MAC), etc.
  - In terms of adaptive responses which involve specific recognition and memory against particular pathogens/antigens by T cells or B lymphocytes, these agents can be recognized when processed through antigen-presenting cell's machinery involving MHC molecules with the help from various receptors like Dendritic Cells (DC), Macrophages and others.
  - In case of parasites or viruses that hide within our cells, other PRR types including RIG-I Like Receptor family members can recognize nucleocapsid components indicating intruders inside the cell body to activate immune responses such as Interferon release etc., further involving various cytokines and chemokines for coordinating a complex defense.
   Overall, it's not just one type of molecule or agent being detected but rather an array which collectively helps our bodies recognize invasion/damage signals efficiently!";423;10;1;60.51893925666809;14.733377358490557;93.84905660377359
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;"The area of theoretical computer science that involves the classification of computational problems based on their complexity (difficulty) is known as ""Computational Complexity Theory."" Within this field, researchers study different classes of computation to understand which problems can be efficiently solved (""efficiently"" often referring to polynomial time with respect to problem size), and those believed or proven to require non-polynomial time.

Some key complexity classes include:

1. **P (Polynomial Time)** – Problems that can be solved in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine, which are considered tractable for practical computation purposes. Examples of problems in P include sorting and matrix multiplication with optimized algorithms.

2. **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time)** – This class includes decision problems where the solutions can be verified quickly if presented these might not necessarily have quick deterministic methods to solve them, but a hypothetical ""nondeterministic"" machine could evaluate all possible paths simultaneously and arrive at an answer in polynomial time. Examples include many classic computational challenges such as factoring large integers (SOLVITY problem) or the traveling salesman decision version where finding one particular solution is hard but verifying a given candidate for it might be fast.

3. **P vs NP** – One of the most famous unsolved questions in computer science: whether problems whose solutions can quickly verified (NP), also have quick methods to find these answers (i.e., they are actually solvable by deterministic polynomial-time algorithms). This relates directly to a range of practical and theoretical implications, from cryptography reliance on the hardness assumption downfall if P equals NP.

4. **NP-complete** – A subset within NP consisting problems for which any problem in NP can be reduced (transformed) into them using polynomial time computation they are notoriously difficult and have no known solution faster than brute force search, or ""backtracking."" The traveling salesman's decision version is a prototypical example of an intractable but verifiable problem if P ≠ NP.

5. **NP-hard** – Problems that are at least as hard as the most difficult problems in NP they need not be solvable by non-deterministic machines quickly, nor do their solutions necessarily reside within any standard complexity class (like polynomial time). An example is optimization issues like scheduling or routing.

6. **Existential and Universal Fixed Points** – Concepts used to determine the existence of fixed points in various computational problems which correspond respectively with least/greatest elements under certain constraints within a partially ordered set, relevant for some areas including lambda calculus semantics analysis (see Kleene's recursion theorem).

7. **Logspace and LPC class** – For decision questions where only logarithmic space suffices to decide them these relate closely with tractability in distributed systems or when physical resources are limited as they reflect the minimal amount of memory required by an algorithm, not counting its working time complexity directly but focusing on storage.

8. **BPP (Bounded-error Probabilistic Polynomial Time)** – Relies on randomness problems where a probabilistic Turing machine can solve them in polynomial time with only small probability of error. It's an analogue to NP for algorithms that may have some errors, but are generally efficient and correct when they do not miscalculate (like primality testing before the famous AKS algorithm which proved P could equal BPP).

9. **PH or Polynomial-Time Hierarchy** – Generalizes beyond problems solvable in polynomial time by deterministic machines to include a series of complexity classes with alternating quantifiers, representing increasing levels and types of nondeterminism (such as NP problems can be thought about within the first level).

10. **ZPP or Zero-error Probabilistic Polynomial Time** – Similar but stricter than BPP if a problem is in ZPP, it means there's no error probability at all when solving using randomness (probability of success and failure are both zero) problems here have efficient probabilistically polynomial algorithms.

10 **L/SLP or Levinstein Polynomial Space** – An extension to space complexity that uses an exponential time but a logarithmic amount of memory, related closely with the non-uniform complexity class P (solvable in deterministic polylogarithmic space) and beyond into ""space explosion"" territory.

10 **QMA/qIP or Quantum Merlin Arthur** – Related to interactive proof systems but for quantum computers where a prover, using the principles of superpositioning can efficiently verify solutions with high probability (analogous in some ways to classical BPP).

These complexity classes form networks that help characterize which problems are tractable or intractable and underpin much research into fundamental limits on what computer algorithms might accomplish. They also provide insightful frameworks for understanding the nature of computational hardness, such as why certain optimization tasks appear difficult (NP-hard), whether some algorithmically simple operations like addition can be carried out efficiently in quantum computing contexts, or if seemingly complex problems are really just limited by practical considerations rather than intrinsic difficulty.

33;What percentile of gross domestic product is construction comprised of?;six to nine percent;"The percentage contribution of the construction sector to a country'se Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can vary significantly depending on economic structure, development stage, and current market conditions. As such information changes over time and across different countries or regions within a single nation, it would be necessary to refer to specific data for accurate figures.

For instance: 
- In the United States in Q1 of 2020 (before significant impacts from COVID-19), construction was estimated by BLS at about $1.7 trillion which accounted approximately for around 6% of GDP.  
- However, these numbers can differ substantially among countries or even within different regions in the same country due to factors like urbanization rates and public investments on infrastructure. For accurate statistics tailored towards a specific location's construction sector as part of its GDP percentage at any given moment, I recommend checking up-to-date economic reports from reliable sources such as government labor departments or international organizations (like the World Bank).

Remember that these percentages represent just one aspect of understanding how crucial an industry is in a country's economy. It does not necessarily indicate its overall importance – factors like employment, market size and scale also matter for this perspective on economic health.";201;10;4;20.809977531433105;14.753941176470585;93.3529411764706

35;Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?;Antigone;"The play by Sophocles where themes of civil disobedience can be identified is not explicitly labeled as such within its title or main narrative. However, ""Antigone"" might resonate with the concept you're referring to due to its exploration of individual moral duty versus state law—a form of dissent in a patriarchal society represented by Thebes and dictated through Creon’thy edicts.

In Sophocles' tragedy ""Antigone,"" the protagonist, Antigone, openly defies King Creon's decree that her brother Polyneisses be left unburied as punishment for killing another of his sons during a power struggle within their family and city state. She believes in divine law over human laws when it comes to burial rights—a sacred act essential according to Greek religious belief at the time, which mandates proper rites even beyond mortal decrees (425 BCE).

Antigone's civil disobedience is a moral choice that challenges Creon’s authority and highlights her personal values. Her actions set off tragic consequences as she stands firm against the law, leading to conflict with not only King Creon but also herself in an internal struggle between obediently following state laws or adhering to family loyalty and religious duty—a profound exploration of conscience versus civic responsibility that resonates through centuries.

This act can be interpreted as civil disobedience because Antigone is consciously choosing a higher moral law over the decrees imposed by her ruler, reflecting acts where individuals stand against perceived injustices within their government or social system for ethical reasons—a theme that has been pivotal throughout history and remains relevant today.

Thus, Sophocles' ""Antigone"" not only tells a story of family loyalty but also poses timeless questions about the balance between state laws and personal convictions it compels audiences to consider when breaking rules may be necessary for what they perceive as higher justice. It is this complex interplay that has made ""Antigone"" an enduring classic, studied not only in literary circles but also within ethical discussions of civil disobedience across time and cultures.";325;10;1;38.1020610332489;14.694848484848483;92.63636363636364
36;University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?;various academic disciplines;"The University of Chicago, where numerous influential and renowned scholars have worked throughout its history, has contributed to various developments across multiple disciplines. Here are some notable areas:

1. Behavioral Economics – Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler's work on ""mental accounting,"" loss aversion, social norms and fairness in economic decisions is an example of groundbreaking research that originated from scholars at the University of Chicago or have influenced their teaching methods.

2. Law – The university has been influential within legal studies through faculty like Ronald Dworkin's interpretive theory, which argues for a moral reading of law beyond its literal meaning and strict application this concept is integral to contemporary jurisprudence discussions worldwide.

3. Philosophy/Ethics – The work on ""virtue ethics"" by Alasdair MacIntyre in the late 20th century, which emphasizes individual character as a key element of moral life and informed modern social theory has roots related to scholars at this institution.

4. Economic Policy & Practice – Chicago School economists have had significant impacts on economic policy design, particularly through their advocacy for free market principles these contributions are rooted in the university's approach towards understanding capitalism and its challenges within public finance policies globally.

5. Education Reform - The school has been at forefront of education reform movements aiming to modernize teaching practices based on empirical research – a trend that started with scholars from this institution, notably Diane Ravitch's work criticizing standardized testing and corporal punishment in schools (which is still highly relevant today).

6. Public Health - Scholarship around public health issues such as the spread of diseases or strategies to tackle global epidemics also originate from this institution, with faculty often contributing valuable insight into understanding these complex phenomena and creating impactful interventions based on their studies.

7. Urban Studies – Scholars at UChicago have been pioneers in the field of urban sociology they’ve shaped our comprehension about how cities evolve, functioning as vibrant organisms with myriad socio-economic dynamics - a topic that continues to gain importance given today's global city growth.
   
These are but some examples from the broad and diverse body of work produced by University of Chicago scholars over time across different fields – underscoring its role as an intellectual hub fostering significant advancements in academia at large, worldwide research initiatives & policy-making processes too!";384;11;3;45.02645206451416;14.71392307692307;93.15384615384616
37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;"The term ""imperialism"" originates from the Latin root words. Specifically, it comes from 'im'- meaning not and '-per-', a prefix also derived from Greek ('pera'), indicating complete or thoroughly, combined with ""-ialis,"" another suffix of Latin descent which denotes relating to something. Therefore, imperialism essentially means ""not pertaining completely"" within the context in which these words were used historically - referring to an attitude that prioritizes one's own empire and often seeks expansion by force or coercion beyond its national borders.";81;10;1;9.574552536010742;14.689571428571428;94.71428571428571
38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP);"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was not directly established by any United Nations organization. Instead, it is an autonomous international body comprised of thousands of scientists from all over the world who assess scientific information related to climate change. The IPCC was set up in 1988 through a joint effort among several organizations:

1. **World Meteorological Organization (WMO)** - This organization is concerned with global weather and climate issues, which aligns closely with one of the main focuses of the IPCC'dict role to assess scientific information on these subjects. The WMO has been a driving force behind setting up bodies such as the UN Environment Programme’s Commission for Sustainable Development (UNEP).

2. **United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)** - UNEP was established in 1948 and plays an integral role by providing leadership on environmental issues, assisting countries in implementing environmentally sound policies globally to benefit mankind and help build sustainable societies that serve their communities’ needs.

Together, these organizations formed the IPCC through a partnership agreement with governments worldwide for assessment reports which provide comprehensive information about climate science, impacts, adaptation strategies, vulnerability, mitigation options, and potential future scenarios related to global warming that can help policymakers in their efforts.

It's important to note the IPCC is not a UN organization itself but acts as an interface between scientific findings on climatic changes and policy-making decisions at various governmental levels around the world hence, its reports are influential within broader discussions occurring under different United Nations forums.";248;6;12;28.154322147369385;14.738458333333336;94.83333333333333
39;Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?;Diatomic oxygen;The gas that makes up approximately 20.8% of the Earth' extraterrestrial atmopshere is nitrogen (N2). More specifically, about 78% consists of Nitrogen and around 21% oxygen (O2), with argon making up roughly 0.93%, trace amounts of other gases including carbon dioxide makeup the remaining percentage. The figure you mentioned, however, seems to be a rounded approximation or could potentially refer to nitrous oxide under specific conditions which is not as abundant in Earth's atmosphere. Always ensure when reading such figures that they align with commonly accepted atmospheric composition ratios unless context specifies otherwise (e.g., measurements after certain environmental changes).;99;9;2;12.716552734375;14.7302;94.3
40;What is the Yuan dynasty's official name?;the Great Yuan;"The official name for China during the time of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) was ""Great Yuan"" or ""Da Yuan."" The term 'Yuan' itself comes from the word used by Mongols, which means “origin” in their language. This dynastic period marked a significant foreign rule under Kublai Khan and his successors after they established control over China following the conquest of the Song Dynasty.";63;7;3;8.294401407241821;14.662333333333331;92.16666666666667
41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens;"The agents detected by the immune system include a variety of pathogens such as:

1. Bacteria – these are single-celled microorganisms that can be either beneficial (like those in our gut) or harmful when they cause an infection. Examples like Streptococcus and Staphylococcus bacteria often trigger immune responses as the body fights off what it perceives to be foreign invaders.

2. Viruses – much smaller than cells, viruses require a host cell's machinery for replication they can cause diseases such as the flu (influenza virus) or common cold and more severe conditions like HIV/AIDS when detected by our immune system.

3. Fungi – these are organisms that include yeast, molds, and related species which sometimes enter into host bodies causing infections for example, Candida can cause thrush or ringworm if the skin'thy encountered with a pathogenic fungus like Trichophyton dermatophytosis.

4. Parasites – these organisms live at an expense to their hosts and include protozoa (like Giardia, which causes giardiasis), helminths or worm-type parasites that can lead to diseases like ascariasis with its causative agent Ascaris lumbricoides.

5. Prions – these are misfolded proteins capable of inducing other normally folded proteins in the brain and nervous system, leading to severe conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). 

These agents trigger an immune response when they enter our bodies. Our body's first line defense involves physical barriers like skin or mucus membranes trying to prevent entry of these pathogens, and once inside it employs various cells such as leukocytes which detect the presence of microorganisms through pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognize molecular patterns common in many types of bacteria, viruses or fungi. These PRRs then initiate an immune response to fight off these invaders and maintain healthy homeostasis within our bodies.";290;10;1;38.2274169921875;14.687666666666667;89.96969696969697
42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;"European Union (EU) law encompassees a complex system of laws and legal principles that are directly applicable or need to be transposed into the national legislation of member states. It comprises various types of norms, including treaties, directives, regulations, decisions, recommendations, opinions, and general principles derived from sources outside EU law but recognized by it as playing an important role in interpreting its legal framework:

1. **Treaties/Founding Acts** – These are the core of European Union Law they establish foundational elements like the aims (EU's objectives and values), competences, institutions structure, voting system within EU bodies such as Council or Parliament, decision-making processes etc., which include:
   - Treaty on European Union (TEU) – outlines fundamental principles for conducting all aspects of union operations. It provides the basis upon which other laws are made and interpreted in line with its values like peaceful cooperation between member states respect to human dignity, freedom, democracy etc. promoting economic progress, while ensuring employment rights at workplace among others.
   - Treaty on Functioning of European Union (TFEU) – details how the EU's institutions function and operate along with their competences in areas like internal market, customs union common commercial policy competition rules etc., which are more technical than TEUs principles but also based upon its values.
   
2. **Directives/Regulations** - These laws require member states to achieve a certain result while allowing countries the freedom of form and methodology: 
   Regulation – these have direct effect, meaning they become law immediately in all EU jurisdictions without requiring national implementation (e.g., Consumer Rights Directive). This kind of legislation applies uniformly across entire European Union territory regardless of variations among member states' legal systems or traditions. They are binding and directly applicable to individuals as well entities within their competencies under the law, but only after being transposed into domestic laws where needed (e.g., General Data Protection Regulation - GDPR).
   
   Directive – require each country implementing them through national legislation so that every state's legal system will give effect to certain outcomes or standards set by the European Commission although their effects are uniform throughout, they must be adapted into domestic law (e.g., Working Time Regulations in UK). While transposing directives, countries may retain some discretion regarding form and implementation methods as long it adheres strictly within given boundaries of effect or standard set by the EU Directive itself thus ensuring legal harmonization across Europe while respecting national differences.
   
3. **Decisions & Recommendations** – Unlike treaties (foundational acts) which establish structures and systems for operation, these are intended to provide specific guidance on certain issues related directly with EU's functioning or policies: they bind individuals/entities who were addressed by them binding nature may differ based upon their type. Decisions have direct effect within the area targeted in it (e.g., impositions made against national companies failing comply to GDPR).
   
4. **Recommendations & Opinions** – These are non-binding instruments used primarily for influencing political debates or legislative work at EU level rather than setting legal standards: they inform and provide guidance but lack coercive power aiming more towards fostering transparency, dialogue between member states.
   
5. **General Principles of Law** – These are recognized as vital in interpreting various aspects related to European Union law including human rights (European Convention on Human Rights), fundamental freedoms(EU Charter -Treaty establishing the EU) and other core values such as democracy, rule of law etc these principles guide interpretation throughout all layers within legal system without being codified directly into specific legislation.
   
6. **Case Law** – The judicial decisions made by courts like European Court Of Justice (ECJ), General Court or Civil Service Tribunal shape development and application over time, establishing precedents which may influence future interpretations even beyond immediate context these are equally binding across all member states under EU law framework as they ensure consistency & predictability in how laws function.
7 **Legal Instruments outside of Directive/Regulation norms** – Include various measures taken by Commission or Parliament like implementing directives, delegated acts etc. their importance cannot be undermined because without these specific rules being adopted at supranational level they wouldn't effectively contribute towards harmonizing standards throughout member states.
   
In essence European Union law is meant to ensure that there remains a unified legal framework governing the way EU operates as an organization while concurrently respecting diversity across its constituent nations which might have different historical backgrounds, cultural values and political philosophies shaping their individual constitutional identity. It works towards balancing harmonization of laws for smooth functioning along with cooperation at supranational level without disregarding national specificities where possible (through directives). This delicate balance between unity & respectfulness to diversity makes up the backbone behind European Union Law's complex structure today.";776;5;26;88.73771929740906;14.775759493670876;93.60759493670886
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"Philosophers and scientists during the classical period of ancient Greece, such as Archimedes (circa 287-212 BCE), used principles that can be seen today as precursencyors to modern mechanics. They studied devices like levers, pulleys, inclined planes, wedges, and screws—collectively known in antiquity often simply under the term ""simple machines""—to understand mechanical advantage (the increased force exerted by a machine), efficiency, work done, energy transfer, and ultimately laws of physics.

These early scholars observed these basic devices at play naturally or through constructed experiments to deduce their principles: 
1. **Lever Principle** - Archimedes is famously known for the statement ""Give me a place to stand on,"" which implies his understanding that levers amplify force when used with different lengths of arms and fulcrums, although this quote has been somewhat embellished over time as it was more likely about specific problems he sought solutions.
2. **Pulley Principle** - They understood the mechanical advantage pulleys provided in lifting heavy loads by distributing weight across multiple sections or cables of a rope system. 
3. **Inclined Plane (Slide) and Sledges: The Ramps Used for Transportation/Hoisting Objects** - They used ramps to move objects upwards with less force than lifting them straight vertically, which indicates their understanding of how incline angles affect the effort required.
4. **Wedging Principle (Prismatic Wedge) and Splitting Wood or Stone: The Efficient Division Task** - They understood that wedges convert horizontal forces into vertical ones to split materials with ease due to gravity acting upon them, which again implies an understanding of force directionality.
5. **Screw Theory – Ancient Architectural Innovations (like the Helepolis) and Water Clocks** - They manipulated screw threads for lifting water or moving objects vertically upward without direct human effort at first glance, showing an early grasp of rotational motion principles coupled with vertical force transmission.
6. **Understanding Mechanical Advantage through Calculations: Early Forerunners to the Idea of a Second Law by Newton** - They were interested in quantifying these machines' efficiencies and calculating how much work could be done, which was essential for constructing buildings or machinery that required precise engineering.
7. **Philosopher Aristotle’s Consideration on Forces: The Underlying Concept of a Force to Momentum Ratio** - Though not as advanced in his thoughts about machines compared with Archimedes, he wrote extensively on physics and the principles governing motion which hinted at some understanding that could be applied when considering simple machines.
8. **Mechanical Systems Interactions: Observations of How Different Devices Work Together** – While not strictly studying these alone as 'simple' devices but rather their applications in more complex systems, they often considered how different mechanical parts interacted and contributed to the efficiency or purpose (like using pulleys with levers).
9. **Conceptualization of Energy Transfer: From Potential to Kinetic** – They pondered on why certain actions required effort before rewards could be obtained—understanding that stored energy, when released appropriately through these devices, transformed into kinetic or motionable force, even though they may not have used the term ""energy"" in its modern sense.
10. **Applications of Mathematics: Pythagoras and Euclid’s Influence** – The application of mathematics to understand geometrical relations was essential for analyzing how shapes (like wedges) worked, although detailed proof wasn't common until after their time with the likes of Archimedes.
   
These studies laid groundwork that would eventually contribute significantly more fully articulated theories in classical mechanics during later periods like those contributed by Newton and others who built upon these earlier foundational ideas about simple machines, forces, energy transfers, motion laws (now encapsulated within modern physical sciences).";584;11;4;70.32854771614075;14.76027419354838;93.80645161290323
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"Private and public schools in many countries operate under different legal frameworks, offering distinct rights and freedoms. Here are some key distinctions typically found between the two:

1. Fee Structure – Private schools usually charge tuition fees which can be higher than those at most public institutions since they often provide specialized programs or may have additional amenities (like uniforms, transportation, extracurricular activities). Public school funding is primarily through tax revenues and must adhere to state education standards.

2. Autonomy – Private schools usually enjoy greater autonomy when it comes to curriculum design: they can choose their educational philosophy, select textbooks not approved by the local department of public instruction (if applicable), set school hours, hire staff according to personal beliefs and values without as much direct oversight from government education agencies. Public schools generally follow state-mandated standards for core subjects like math and language arts.

3. School Choice – Private schools provide parents with an alternative choice if they believe their child's needs are not being met by the public school system, or to gain access to specific academic programs (like special education). This can also apply within state systems where charter schools operate as a form of private institution under government authorization.

4. Religious Freedom – Many religiously affiliated independent/private schools have rights that are protected so they may teach according to their faith’s doctrines, which often include character education and moral development in line with the school's belief system—an aspect not typically found within public institutions due to strict separation of church and state.

5. Student Admission – Private schools can set admission policies that reflect selective criteria or may use test scores for college preparatory programs, which is often at odds with non-discriminatory practices in many countries' laws governing public education (Title IX being a key example). Public school systems are generally required to admit students without regard to race, socioeconomic status, religion, or disability.

6. Extracurricular Activities – Private schools might offer more diverse and specialized extracurricular activities than most state-funded institutions but these should still be within the realm of what's allowed by law for private entities (though this can sometimes differ from one country to another). 

7. Funding Diversity – Some countries have laws allowing schools, including public ones, to establish multiple sources of income beyond government funding—private donations and endowments are common in the case of many American independent/charter or magnet institutions but these mechanisms usually do not extend into state-operated systems with limited exceptions.

It's important to note that while private schools have certain liberties, they must still comply with education standards set by authorities and may be subjected to regulations regarding discrimination laws (in jurisdictions where such legislation exists). Moreover, in many places like the United States or Europe, public funding for these institutions is often a topic of political debate.

For specifics on rights that differ significantly between private schools not found within most public school systems—often depending upon local and national laws —consult legal experts familiar with your country's education system to clarify any potential differences or peculiarities in practice.";512;10;4;54.070807695388794;14.729510638297876;94.57446808510639
45;What is the largest stadium in Australia?;Melbourne Cricket Ground;"The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Victoria, which hosts cricket and Australian Rules Football matches among other events, has one of the largest capacities however, when referring specifically to football/soccer capacity as some might interpret ""largest,"" then Allianz Field with a seating capacity for soccer is often considered quite significant.

Here are details about both:

1. Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG): Situated in Yarra Park, Victoria, the MCG has an official total stadium size of around 100 acres and can hold up to approximately 100,000 spectators for sports events with a full capacity when it comes to cricket. The largest crowd was estimated at about 95,000 during Australia's World Cup match against Pakistan in the same year (note: capacities may vary depending on seating and standing arrangements).

2. Allianz Field Sydney FC Stadium: Situated within Marrickville Oval next to Bankstown Sporting Complex - it is a versatile stadium with various configurations for different types of events, including football/soccer matches which can seat around 80-15,000 people depending on the configuration.

It's important to clarify that when considering ""largest"" in terms of general venue size (indoor vs outdoor and specific event capacity), there could be other large stadiums or arenas like Sydney Football Stadium for various sports with extensive facilities but differing capacities based on their primary use cases. For instance, Netball Australia's headquarters are housed within a larger complex that includes multiple venues of varying sizes as it caters to different events beyond football/soccer and netball specifically.

If we narrow down the criteria for ""largest"" strictly in terms of cricket or Australian Football (football) stadiums with seating, then Melbourne Cricket Ground would be considered Australia's largest such facility due to its significant capacity when configured appropriately—though Allianz Field is noteworthy as well and holds large crowds for soccer events.

To address the confusion further: there might also exist misunderstandings related to venue usage or temporary arrangements that can alter perceived size (like pop-up stands). Moreover, Australia's vast geographical area with multiple sporting complexes dedicated to a range of sports makes it challenging without specific context. For precise information on capacity and the largest stadium in terms of your exact criteria—please provide further details about what kind of events or seating type you are referring too (standing, all-seater, temporary structures etc.).

46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters;Ctenophores, also known as comb jellies, are marine invertebrates that primarily inhabit oceanic environments. They can be found in both tropical and temperate waters worldwide, from the surface to depths of up to several hundred meters below sea level (the bathypelagic zone). Some species may even venture into brackish water occasionally or during certain life stages if conditions allow for it. Their distribution is generally extensive within marine ecosystems due to their wide range tolerance and ability to survive in various salinities, but they are most abundant in the shallow waters where sunlight penetrates sufficiently deep enough for them to feed on plankton with relative ease using their comb-like ciliary rows.;111;4;2;12.51143765449524;14.730299999999996;87.4
47;In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?;Brazil;Most of the Amazon rainforest is located within Brazil. The vast majority (more than half) of this large and biodiverse forest resides in the northern part of South America, with significant portions also extending into Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas territory of France). However, Brazil is by far the country containing the largest area covered by this important ecosystem.;66;11;1;8.18668508529663;14.677833333333332;93.5
48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;"The European Union (EU) has a bicameral parliamentary system which consists of:
1. The European Parliament - This is directly elected by EU citizens and represents them at an institutional level, with members called Members of the European Parliament or MEPs who sit in political groups according to their shared policy priorities rather than national affiliation alone (although they are organized along regional lines). It has legislative authority when acting jointly with the Council of the EU.
2. The Council of the European Union, often simply called ""the Council"" - This body represents member state governments and is made up of one representative from each government – a minister or high-level official who can propose laws for discussion (most commonly done through intergovernmental negotiations). It also has legislative authority when acting jointly with the European Parliament.
Together, these two bodies work in tandem to create and adopt EU law alongside other institutions such as the Commission of the European Union which proposes new initiatives that may become laws or policies for consideration by both parliaments during a process called 'co-decision' (now known under this term within all aspects except foreign affairs). This ensures democratic legitimacy and transparency in EU legislation.
In addition to these primary institutions, there are also other entities like the European Commission which proposes new laws Court of Justice for interpreting existing ones or settling disputes over their application while working closely with them through procedures set out within treaties agreed upon by member states on how exactly this complex system operates.
Lastly it's worth noting that some EU policies require more specialized cooperation between countries (such as custom union) here instead than parliamentary elections take place at regional and national levels where political parties compete for votes from citizens based solely within one country - however these too play an essential role in shaping the overall direction of any specific policy area under discussion.
Overall though, it can be said that through both shared goals as well individual contributions each component provides key input into how we govern ourselves at this unique supranational level whereby decisions made may not only impact citizens' lives but also shape global politics today!";363;12;9;36.00429844856262;14.68738709677419;92.64516129032258
49;The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?;Westminster;The Scottish Parliament can only pass laws on matters that are not within the remit of reserved issues. These reserved areas fall under the purview of the UK Parliament in Westminster, London. The Scotland Act 1998 and subsequent amendments define what is devolved (reserved for Holyrodd) to which aspects each legislative body has authority over. If a matter falls into one of these reserves—such as defense, foreign affairs or immigration—then only the UK Parliament can create laws on that subject in Scotland however, if it's within their competencies such as education and healthcare (as largely established by previous devolution agreements), then they may legislate. The exact boundaries are often a topic of political negotiation between Edinburgh and London to ensure clarity for both governments operating concurrently with shared sovereignty in the United Kingdom's constitutional framework.;135;18;1;14.82671594619751;14.757999999999997;94.83333333333333
