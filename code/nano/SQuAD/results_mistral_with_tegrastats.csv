6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;" The theorem that highlights the fundamental role of primes in number theory is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. This theorem states that every positive integer greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of primes, and these prime factors are unique up to their order.

This means if you take any number n > 1, there exists a unique set of prime numbers p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ such that:

n = p₁ * p₂ * ... * pₙ

Moreover, none of the prime factors can be factored further. The uniqueness of this factorization makes primes indispensable in understanding the structure and properties of numbers within the positive integer domain.";113;11;5;21.169978380203247;14.897277777777775;95.66666666666667

14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters; Ctenophora, also known as Comb Jellies or Sea Walnuts, are a phylum of aquatic, primarily marine, invertebrate animals. They are characterized by their unique body structure and eight rows of cilia called comb plates, which give them a transparent, comb-like appearance and allow them to swim efficiently. Unlike most other animals, Ctenophora do not have true tentacles, a nervous system, or a digestive tract. Instead, they have a unique feeding method where they expel water through their mouths, creating a current that carries food particles into their bodies.;88;4;8;17.4222252368927;14.918499999999998;93.85714285714286

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;" Imperialism is typically administered through a variety of means that aim to control and exploit territories and peoples. Here are some common methods:

1. Colonial Administration: This involves the creation of a system of governance over the conquered territory, often with native leaders serving as puppets or collaborators. The colonial power would appoint its own officials, establish its legal systems, and enforce them through police forces and military might.

2. Economic Exploitation: Imperial powers would typically extract resources (such as minerals, timber, agricultural products) from the colonies for their own benefit. This was often achieved through monopolistic trading companies that had a near-total control over commerce in the colonies.

3. Cultural Assimilation: Imperial powers would often impose their language, religion, and customs on the colonized people as a means of controlling them and making them more amenable to imperial rule. This process is also known as ""acculturation"" or ""assimilation.""

4. Infrastructure Development: To facilitate the extraction of resources and the administration of the colony, imperial powers would often invest in infrastructure projects such as roads, railways, ports, and telecommunications networks. These projects were usually designed to serve the needs of the imperial power rather than the local population.

5. Military Force: The ultimate means of enforcing imperial rule was military force. Imperial armies were used to suppress any resistance to imperial rule, and to maintain order in the colonies.

6. Political Manipulation: Imperial powers would often engage in political manipulation to ensure that friendly leaders came to power or remained in power in the colonies. This could involve supporting one faction over another, or providing financial and military support to pro-imperial rulers.

7. Education and Propaganda: The imperial power would often invest in education systems in the colonies, with the aim of indoctrinating the local population with imperial ideologies and values. This could also involve propaganda campaigns aimed at justifying imperial rule and promoting positive images of the imperial power.

8. Economic Dependency: By controlling key aspects of the economy, such as trade and finance, the imperial power would create a state of economic dependency in the colonies. This made it difficult for the colonies to resist imperial rule or to seek independence.";363;7;8;65.59442591667175;14.8986551724138;94.3103448275862
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;" Improving upon Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion was not a linear process and happened over several centuries, with many contributors. The principles themselves were established in the late 17th century with Newton's ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia"" (1687).

However, refinements and extensions to these foundational laws were made by other scientists for centuries after Newton. For example, James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic equations (late 19th century) and Albert Einstein's theory of relativity (early 20th century) are notable advancements that expanded our understanding of motion in various contexts such as electromagnetism and high velocities.

So, it did not take a specific amount of time to improve upon Newton's laws, but rather, progress has been continuous over the course of several centuries by many influential scientists.";122;14;4;25.312839031219482;14.89985714285714;94.80952380952381
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"1. Political System: Islamism advocates for the implementation of an Islamic state or caliphate, governed by Sharia law. This includes political and legal systems that adhere to Islamic principles.

2. Society and Culture: Islamism aims to integrate Islamic values and practices into every aspect of society, from education and family life to art, literature, and entertainment. It encourages Muslims to practice their faith openly and actively in all aspects of their lives.

3. Economy: Many Islamist movements advocate for an economic system that aligns with Islamic principles, such as the prohibition of interest (riba) and investments in businesses that comply with Islamic ethical guidelines (Sharia-compliant finance).

4. Education: Islamism seeks to integrate Islamic studies into the curriculum, teaching children about their faith, its history, and its practices from a young age. It also encourages the establishment of educational institutions that adhere to Islamic principles.

5. Foreign Policy: Islamism often influences foreign policy, with a focus on issues such as Palestine, Kashmir, or other regions where Muslims live, promoting solidarity among Muslim communities worldwide and advocating for their rights.

6. Justice System: Sharia law is central to the justice system under Islamism, addressing areas such as crime, family law, and commercial transactions. It emphasizes forgiveness, restorative justice, and the protection of individual rights within a broader social context.

7. Personal Conduct: Islamism seeks to encourage Muslims to adhere strictly to Islamic practices in their daily lives, including prayer, fasting during Ramadan, charity, and other acts of worship and piety.

8. Community and Social Services: Islamist movements often provide community services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare programs that align with Islamic principles. These services are intended to support the needs of Muslims and reinforce the importance of living a life in accordance with Islamic teachings.

9. Media and Communications: Islamism encourages the establishment of media outlets and communications channels that promote Islamic values, educate the public about Islam, and counter negative stereotypes and misinformation.

10. International Relations: Islamist movements aim to build alliances with like-minded groups and nations, advocating for a unified Muslim world that upholds Islamic principles and values in its interactions with other countries and international organizations.";359;11;4;66.79605531692505;14.90001694915255;96.40677966101696

22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;" To answer this question, we need to clarify what ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" refers to. Generally, a millionaire is someone who has a net worth or wealth of $1 million or more. The term ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" could refer to individuals with a net worth of at least $10 million, but this group isn't specifically defined and can vary based on sources and criteria used for calculations.

In 2008, there were approximately 930,000 U.S. households with a net worth between $10 million and $25 million, according to the Spectrem Group. Based on this information, we cannot calculate an exact figure for ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" in 2008 because it is not clear whether we are referring to individuals or households, and the wealth of these people would also vary within this group.

However, if we take the average net worth of these households (around $16.5 million), we can estimate that the combined wealth of the ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" in 2008 was around $15.4 trillion USD ($930,000 households * $16.5 million per household). Keep in mind that this is only an estimation and may not represent the actual figure for the total wealth of ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" in 2008.";201;14;3;42.17750263214111;14.882432432432433;94.32432432432432
23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973; The 1973 oil crisis, also known as the October War or Yom Kippur War crisis, began on October 16, 1973. This was when Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur. As a result, several Arab oil-producing states declared an embargo on oil exports to countries that supported Israel. The crisis had significant global economic consequences, causing a sharp increase in oil prices worldwide.;72;7;2;14.269116401672363;14.906363636363636;93.45454545454545
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries; The Normans, also known as the Vikings of Nord-France, arrived in what is now modern-day Normandy (in France) during the late 9th and early 10th centuries. They established themselves as a powerful force in the region by the end of the 10th century, founding the Duchy of Normandy under their leader Rollo around 911 AD. The Norman Duchy lasted until 1204, when it was incorporated into the French Kingdom by King Philip II Augustus after the death of Richard the Lionheart (Richard I of England) during the Third Crusade. So, in a broad sense, you can say that the Normans were in Normandy for about 300 years from the late 9th to early 13th centuries.;115;6;4;23.371021509170532;14.88955;96.95
25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;" The term you're looking for is ""Civil Disobedience."" Civil disobedience is a method of protesting or resisting laws, typically non-violent resistance, that one considers unjust, immoral, or oppressive. This concept was famously explored by philosophers like Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi. In civil disobedience, people refuse to obey certain laws or rules, often facing the consequences of their actions in order to bring attention to the perceived injustice.";69;15;2;15.291949987411499;14.89425;94.5
26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;" The main sources of primary law, which are the fundamental rules and principles from which all other laws are derived, vary depending on the legal system in question. Here, I will list some common primary sources across several major jurisdictions:

1. Constitution: A constitution is a fundamental document that outlines the structure and powers of a government, as well as the rights and protections afforded to citizens. In many countries, the constitution serves as the supreme law of the land.

2. Statutes (Acts of Parliament, Bills, Laws): Statutes are written laws passed by the legislative branch of government, which are binding upon all courts, public authorities, and citizens within a jurisdiction. In many common law systems, statutes are published in official gazettes or on relevant government websites.

3. Regulations: Regulations are rules created by administrative agencies to implement the provisions of a statute or to exercise their own delegated authority. They have the force of law and must be followed unless overturned by a court.

4. Case Law (Common Law, Precedent): Case law is made up of judicial decisions made by courts in specific cases. These decisions establish legal principles that can guide future judges when making similar rulings. In common law systems, case law plays an essential role in shaping the development and interpretation of the law.

5. Customary Law: In some jurisdictions, customary laws based on long-standing practices and traditions may serve as a source of primary law. This is particularly relevant in indigenous communities or countries that recognize customary law alongside statutory and common law.

6. International Treaties and Conventions: Countries may enter into agreements with one another to regulate specific aspects of international relations, such as trade, human rights, or environmental protection. These treaties and conventions can be considered sources of primary law in a jurisdiction if they are incorporated into domestic legislation.

7. Constitutional Instruments (e.g., Ordinances, Orders, and Rules): Depending on the country's constitutional structure, various executive orders or legislative instruments may have the force of law. These instruments are typically created to manage specific administrative tasks or to fill gaps in statutory law until new legislation can be passed.

8. Legislative Instruments (e.g., By-laws and Ordinances): In some jurisdictions, local governments may pass by-laws and ordinances that govern matters affecting their particular area or municipality. These instruments often have the force of law within the specified geographic boundaries.";395;8;5;72.9232108592987;14.901937500000013;95.953125
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia; The Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is believed to have originated in Asia. Specifically, it's thought to have started in the bacterial reservoir of yersinia pestis among rodents in rural China in the 14th century, possibly in or near the city of Bayan Jolin (now called Kubala) in Mongolia. From there, it spread westwards along the Silk Road trade routes, reaching Crimea by 1347 and then rapidly spreading across Europe. This version of the plague is known as the Bubonic Plague. However, another theory suggests that it might have originated from the steppes north of the Black Sea in what is now Russia.;109;6;6;21.748542547225952;14.901833333333334;97.33333333333333
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching; Paul Baran developed packet switching, a fundamental technology for modern computer networks. In the 1960s, he proposed a method of digital communication in which data is broken down into smaller packets that are sent individually, rather than sending continuous streams of data. This approach allowed for efficient use of resources, error-checking capabilities, and the ability to route packets around network failures, which significantly improved the reliability and scalability of early computer networks. Baran's work was influential in the development of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the precursor to the modern Internet.;93;5;10;17.205957174301147;14.900214285714284;96.92857142857143

30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens; The agents that the immune system detects are called antigens. Antigens are foreign substances, typically proteins or polysaccharides on the surface of bacteria, viruses, fungi, toxins, or the body's own cells (in autoimmune diseases). These antigens trigger an immune response, allowing the immune system to neutralize and eliminate these harmful substances.;51;10;1;11.933818817138672;14.904;94.44444444444444
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory; The branch of theoretical computer science that broadly classifies computational problems based on their difficulty and class of relationship is called Computational Complexity Theory. It aims to find patterns in the resources (such as time, space, and randomness) required for different computational tasks to be solved, and provides a framework for understanding the limits and trade-offs inherent in algorithms and data structures. The central goals are to determine the complexity classes that group problems with similar resource requirements, and to understand relationships between these classes, such as which classes can solve what types of problems and which classes are more powerful than others.;103;18;3;17.024210214614868;14.888999999999998;94.78571428571429

35;Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?;Antigone; Antigone by Sophocles is a classic example of civil disobedience in ancient Greek literature. In this play, Antigone defies the unjust edict of King Creon by burying her brother Polynices, who had been left unburied due to his betrayal against Thebes. Antigone's actions are motivated by her deep sense of duty to family and the divine laws, which she prioritizes over the civil law of the state. This brave stance ultimately leads to her death but highlights the importance of conscience and morality in the face of unjust authority.;89;10;1;17.23399567604065;14.894571428571428;99.0
36;University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?;various academic disciplines; The development of the Chicago School of Sociology, which was instrumental in shaping modern sociology and urban studies. Key figures like Robert Park, Ernest W.

41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens; The agents that the immune system detects and fights are called Pathogens. These can be bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites or even cancer cells in some cases. Each type of pathogen has specific characteristics that the immune system recognizes and responds to. The immune system has a variety of ways to detect these pathogens, such as antigen recognition by T-cells, antibody production by B-cells, or activation of inflammation responses by macrophages.;70;10;1;14.43089485168457;14.892833333333334;95.5
42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;" European Union (EU) law, also known as Union law or Community law, refers to the legal system that governs the functioning of the European Union. It consists of a body of rules which bind its member states and their peoples. The EU law derives from two main sources:

1. **Treaties**: These are agreements between member states, outlining the fundamental principles, aims, and objectives of the European Union. The most important treaties include the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).

2. **Legislation**: This includes regulations, directives, decisions, and recommendations issued by the EU institutions. Regulations are directly applicable and binding in all member states, while directives require national implementing measures to be taken by each member state. Decisions are usually addressed to a specific entity (e.g., a member state or an individual) and are binding upon receipt. Recommendations and opinions are non-binding.

The EU law is developed and enforced by the seven principal institutions of the European Union:

1. The European Parliament
2. The Council of the European Union
3. The European Commission
4. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
5. The European Council
6. The European Central Bank (ECB)
7. The Court of Auditors

The main objectives of EU law are to promote peace, prosperity, and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people among member states. It also aims to protect human rights, the environment, and consumer interests, as well as establish a single market with a uniform set of rules and standards.";258;5;26;48.45700144767761;14.896095238095235;97.5
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;" The ancient Greek philosophers, particularly Aristotle, studied simple machines under the concept of ""mechanics"" or ""moves"" (techne ton kineson). Aristotle's mechanics was primarily concerned with devices that could transform a given force into another, usually larger, force.

Aristotle identified six simple machines:
1. Lever
2. Pulley
3. Inclined plane
4. Wheel and axle
5. Wedge
6. Screw

Each of these mechanical devices multiplies the effort needed to move an object, making work easier for human beings or animals. In his book ""Mechanics,"" Aristotle delved into the principles and ratios by which these simple machines operate, contributing significantly to our understanding of physics and engineering.";104;11;4;22.743892669677734;14.896368421052628;95.73684210526316
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"1. Curriculum and Pedagogical Flexibility: Private schools often have more freedom in designing their curriculum, teaching methods, and extracurricular activities because they are not bound by state or district guidelines to the same extent as public schools.

2. Tuition Fees: Private schools can charge tuition fees, which is a significant source of revenue that allows them to invest in facilities, technology, and faculty development. Public schools receive funding from tax dollars and must operate within budget constraints set by the local or state government.

3. Selective Admission: Some private schools can be selective in their admissions process, choosing students based on academic record, test scores, extracurricular activities, or other criteria. This is not typically possible for public schools, which must accept all students within a specific geographic area.

4. Autonomous Governance: Private schools are often governed by independent boards of trustees or directors, which may include parents, community leaders, and educational experts. This allows private schools to make decisions about their operations, policies, and strategic direction without the same level of oversight as public schools, which are subject to state and local education department regulations.

5. Specialized Focus: Private schools can specialize in areas such as arts, sciences, religious education, or other specific subjects, catering to a niche market that may not be available in public schools. This allows students with unique interests or needs to receive an education tailored to their preferences.

6. Donations and Fundraising: Private schools can solicit donations from alumni, parents, and community members, providing additional resources for the school's programs and facilities. Public schools may also receive donations but are not typically reliant on private funding in the same way as private schools.";278;10;4;49.999594926834106;14.90120454545454;94.5

46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters; Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies, are marine organisms that primarily inhabit the world's oceans. They prefer cold and temperate waters, although some species have been found in tropical seas. Their habitat often includes areas with a planktonic food source, as they feed on tiny organisms like algae and other small creatures suspended in the water column. They are not typically found in freshwater environments.;65;4;2;12.852612495422363;14.909199999999998;92.4
47;In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?;Brazil; Brazil is home to the majority of the Amazon Rainforest.

48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;" The European Union's legislature consists of two main bodies:

1. The European Parliament (EP): It is the directly elected body, representing the EU citizens. The EP has the power to propose and amend legislation in various policy areas, as well as to approve or reject the EU budget. Its members are elected every five years by EU citizens in a series of elections held across the member states.

2. The Council of the European Union (also known as the Council of Ministers): It represents the governments of the EU member states. The Council is responsible for making decisions on proposed legislation, which it does through a series of committees and meetings. Each member state has one vote in the Council, and the Presidency of the Council rotates among member states every six months.

Together, these two bodies make up the EU's legislature, with joint decision-making power on many issues within the EU's competences. Laws proposed by the European Commission must be approved by both the European Parliament and the Council before they can become law.";175;12;9;29.88123369216919;14.880807692307686;92.84615384615384
49;The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?;Westminster; The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases, subject to the limitation that the powers aren't already reserved by Westminster (the UK Parliament in London).
