3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava);"An igneous rock is a type of rock that forms when magma (molten rock) from the Earth's interior cools and solidifies. As it cools, the minerals within the magma start to precipitate out of solution and form crystals, which eventually come together to form a solid rock.

There are two main types of igneous rocks:

* **Intrusive (or Plutonic)**: These rocks form when magma cools slowly beneath the Earth's surface. They have coarse-grained textures because the slow cooling allows more time for large crystals to grow.
* **Extrusive (or Volcanic)**: These rocks form when lava erupts from a volcano and cools quickly on the surface. They have fine-grained or glassy textures because of the rapid cooling.

So, to summarize, an igneous rock is formed when magma cools and crystallizes!";129;10;7;32.82332515716553;14.855999999999993;94.28571428571429
4;What is the largest city the Rhine runs through?;Cologne, Germany;"The Rhine River runs through several large cities, but some of the most notable ones include:

* Cologne (Köln), Germany: With a population of around 1 million people, Cologne is one of the largest cities on the Rhine.
* Düsseldorf, Germany: Located in North Rhine-Westphalia, Düsseldorf has a population of around 620,000 people and is an important financial and cultural center in the region.
* Rotterdam, Netherlands: While not as large as some other Dutch cities, Rotterdam has a population of around 650,000 people and is one of the busiest ports in Europe.

However, if I had to pick just one city that could be considered the largest city the Rhine runs through, it would probably be Basel, Switzerland. While Basel's population is relatively small at around 170,000 people (though the metropolitan area has over 800,000), its importance as a major cultural and economic center in Europe cannot be overstated.

But if I'm being completely honest, the largest city on the Rhine might actually be Mannheim, Germany. With a population of over 340,000 people, it's one of the biggest cities along the Rhine River and an important industrial and commercial hub in southwestern Germany.

6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;"The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA) is considered a cornerstone of number theory. It states that every positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers in a unique way, except for the order in which those primes are listed.

More formally:

""Every positive integer greater than 1 either is a prime itself or can be factorized uniquely into a product of prime numbers.""

In other words, FTA establishes that every number has a prime factorization, and this factorization is unique. This theorem has far-reaching implications in number theory and has been used to prove many important results in the field.

FTA's main role can be summarized as:

1. **Unique representation**: It provides a unique way of representing any positive integer as a product of primes.
2. **Prime properties**: It highlights the importance of prime numbers, as they are the building blocks of all other numbers.
3. **Factorization**: It shows that every number has a prime factorization, which is essential for many applications in mathematics and computer science.

FTA has been fundamental to the development of number theory and has influenced various areas of mathematics, including algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, and cryptography.";196;11;5;43.50285077095032;14.858921052631572;95.21052631578948

13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France;"The Huguenots, French Protestants, were a significant minority in 17th-century France. Their population was largely centered in the following regions:

1. **Provence**: This region in southeastern France was one of the strongest bastions of Protestantism. Cities like Nîmes, Aix-en-Provence, and Marseille had large Huguenot populations.
2. **Languedoc**: Located in southern France, Languedoc (now part of Occitanie) was another important stronghold for the Huguenots. Cities like Toulouse, Montpellier, and Albi were hotbeds of Protestant activity.
3. **Dauphiné**: This region, situated in eastern France, had a significant Huguenot presence, particularly in cities like Grenoble and Valence.
4. **Brittany**: Although less prominent than the other regions mentioned above, Brittany still had a notable Huguenot population.

However, it's essential to note that many Huguenots lived throughout France, not just in these specific regions. They were scattered across various urban centers, towns, and villages, with some estimates suggesting they made up around 10% of the French population at their peak.

The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 led to a massive exodus of Huguenots from France, as many fled persecution and sought refuge in neighboring countries like Switzerland, Germany, England, or even farther afield in the American colonies.";195;7;7;55.66500759124756;14.849408163265307;92.38775510204081
14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;"Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies or coelenterates (though technically the latter term refers to Cnidarians), are a group of marine animals that belong to the phylum Ctenophora. They're characterized by their distinctive body shape and unique ability to move using specialized cells called cilia.

Here are some key features that define Ctenophora:

1. **Body structure**: Ctenophora have a soft, gelatinous body with radial symmetry, meaning they have parts arranged around a central axis in the form of a wheel or fan.
2. **Comb-like appendages**: As their name suggests (from Greek ""cteno,"" meaning comb), ctenophores are equipped with long, hair-like structures called cilia or cerata, which they use to move through the water and capture prey. These comb-like structures are made of microtubules.
3. **Bioluminescence**: Many species within this phylum have cells that produce bioluminescent light, often used for attracting prey, communication, or defense.
4. **Diet**: Ctenophora are carnivorous, feeding on small organisms like crustaceans, other ctenophores, and plankton.
5. **Reproduction**: They reproduce by budding, where new individuals grow from the parent's body.

Some of the most well-known species within this phylum include:

* **Mnemiopsis leidyi**, a comb jelly that invades freshwater ecosystems
* **Pleurobrachia pileus**, a large and strikingly beautiful comb jelly with a distinctive bell-like shape

Ctenophora are relatively simple organisms, but their ability to capture prey using cilia has intrigued scientists for centuries.";226;4;8;64.31250309944153;14.860894736842111;96.7719298245614

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;"Imperialism has been administered through various means throughout history. Here are some of the most common methods:

1. **Colonial Administration**: This involves setting up a colonial administration, with governors, administrators, and officials overseeing the colonies or territories under imperial control.
2. **Military Occupation**: Imperial powers often use military force to occupy and maintain control over foreign territories. This can involve garrisoning troops, establishing military bases, and imposing martial law.
3. **Indirect Rule**: In this system, local leaders are allowed to govern their territories with a degree of autonomy, while the imperial power maintains overall control and influence through economic or diplomatic means.
4. **Economic Control**: Imperial powers often use economic means to exert control over foreign territories, such as:
	* Exploitation of natural resources (e.g., mining, oil extraction).
	* Establishment of trade monopolies and monopolistic industries.
	* Investment in infrastructure and utilities (e.g., roads, ports, railways).
5. **Cultural Imperialism**: This involves the spread of the imperial power's culture, language, and values to the colonized or occupied territories through education, media, and other means.
6. **Client States**: In this system, an imperial power supports and influences a local government or leader, often in exchange for loyalty, resources, or strategic access.
7. **Proxy Forces**: Imperial powers may use proxy forces (e.g., local militias, mercenaries) to maintain control over territories without direct military involvement.

These methods have been used in various combinations throughout history, depending on the specific context and goals of the imperial power.";242;7;8;59.22711658477783;14.857596153846162;96.28846153846153
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"Actually, Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion were not ""improved"" upon in the sense that they were later shown to be incorrect. Rather, they were built upon and refined by other scientists over time.

Newton first presented his three laws of motion in his book ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687. These laws described the relationship between a body and the forces acting upon it, and they remain fundamental principles in physics to this day.

However, Newton's work was not without controversy or areas for improvement at the time. Some of the notable developments that built upon or refined Newton's laws of motion include:

1. **Lagrange (1788)**: Joseph-Louis Lagrange developed the calculus of variations and used it to derive the equations of motion in a more systematic way, which is now known as the Lagrangian mechanics.
2. **Hamilton (1833)**: William Rowan Hamilton introduced the concept of canonical transformations, which allowed for a more elegant and concise formulation of classical mechanics.
3. **Einstein's Relativity (1905-1915)**: Albert Einstein developed special relativity, which challenged Newton's assumptions about absolute time and space. Later, general relativity was developed, which unified gravity with the rest of physics and provided a new framework for understanding motion in strong gravitational fields.

Other important contributions that built upon or refined Newton's laws include:

* The development of **statistical mechanics** by Ludwig Boltzmann (1872) and others, which provided a probabilistic interpretation of thermodynamics.
* The introduction of the concept of **relativistic mass** by Henri Poincaré (1900) and Einstein (1905), which showed that Newton's laws are still valid but need to be modified at high speeds.

So, while there were certainly important developments in classical mechanics after Newton's time, these improvements built upon or refined his original work rather than correcting any fundamental errors.";298;14;4;73.8550398349762;14.850076923076925;95.35384615384615
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"Islamism, a term used to describe the ideology and movement of implementing Islamic law (Sharia) in all aspects of life, seeks to integrate itself into various aspects of society, including:

1.  **Politics**: Islamists aim to establish an Islamic state or government, where laws are based on Sharia principles.
2.  **Society**: They strive for the implementation of Sharia in social and cultural matters, such as family law, education, and social welfare.
3.  **Economy**: Some Islamist groups advocate for a mixed economy with Islamic finance and banking practices, which comply with Sharia principles.
4.  **Education**: Islamists promote the integration of Islamic studies into school curricula and often establish separate educational institutions that focus on Islamic values and knowledge.
5.  **Media and Communication**: Islamists use various media outlets to disseminate their message, promoting a particular interpretation of Islam and critiquing what they see as Western or secular influences.
6.  **International Relations**: Some Islamist groups, like the Muslim Brotherhood, have engaged in international politics, often with the goal of promoting pan-Islamism and establishing alliances with other Islamic movements.
7.  **Family Law**: Islamists seek to implement Sharia-compliant family laws, including issues related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody.
8.  **Social Welfare**: Islamist organizations often provide social services, such as food banks, healthcare clinics, and educational programs, which are based on Islamic principles.

22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;"A very specific question!

I'm assuming you're referring to a report by Spectrem Group, a market research firm that tracks high net worth individuals. In their 2008 ""Affluent Market Study,"" they identified a group of households with assets exceeding $10 million.

According to the report, there were approximately 55,000 ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" in the United States in 2008.

While I couldn't find an exact figure for their combined wealth, we can estimate it by multiplying the number of households by a rough estimate of the average household net worth. In 2008, Forbes estimated that the median net worth of these individuals was around $12 million to $15 million per household (note: this is not an official Spectrem Group estimate).

Let's assume an average household net worth of $13.5 million for simplicity. Multiplying this by the number of households:

55,000 households × $13,500,000 per household ≈ $742,500,000,000

So, approximately $742.5 billion was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" in 2008.

Please keep in mind that this is a rough estimate and should be taken as a ballpark figure, as the actual number could have varied depending on various factors, such as individual asset values, debt levels, and other financial considerations.";203;14;3;50.25255823135376;14.862659090909093;95.56818181818181

It was triggered by a sudden and dramatic increase in global oil prices following an embargo imposed by several Arab oil-producing countries.

Here's a brief background:

* On October 6, 1973, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel, known as the Yom Kippur War.
* The United States and other Western countries provided military aid to Israel, which was seen as a provocation by the Arab oil-producing countries.
* In response, several Arab oil-producing countries, led by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, and the United Arab Emirates, imposed an embargo on oil exports to the United States and other countries that supported Israel.
* The embargo lasted for about six months, until March 1974.

During this period, oil prices skyrocketed, leading to a global economic crisis. The crisis had a significant impact on the world economy, causing high inflation, recession, and widespread shortages of gasoline and other petroleum products.";173;7;2;41.1752393245697;14.864722222222216;92.72222222222223
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries;"The question is slightly misleading. The Normans were not ""in"" Normandy, as they were the original inhabitants of the region, which was originally known as Neustria and then Northmen's Land (Old Norse: Norðmannaland) by the Viking invasions.

However, if we assume you're asking when the Viking settlers from Scandinavia, who would later become the Normans, first arrived in the area, it's a bit more complicated. The Viking raids on Frankia, which included the region now known as Normandy, started around the mid-9th century.

The first recorded Viking raid in Normandy took place in 840 AD, and by the early 10th century, these Scandinavian settlers had established themselves in the area. Over time, they intermarried with the local population, adopted the Latin culture of the Franks, and developed their own distinct identity.

In the late 9th century, Rollo, a Viking chieftain from Norway (or possibly Denmark), led a successful invasion of Normandy in 911 AD. He was granted the land by Charles III, King of West Francia (modern-day France). This event marked the beginning of the Duchy of Normandy.

So, to answer your question:

* The Viking raids on Normandy began around 840 AD.
* The first recorded settlement of Vikings in the area took place in the early 10th century.
* Rollo led a successful invasion in 911 AD, establishing the Duchy of Normandy.

25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;"When individuals or groups in a society resist, defy, or challenge laws that they believe are unjust or oppressive, this phenomenon is often referred to as:

1. **Civil Disobedience**: This term was coined by Henry David Thoreau in his essay ""Civil Disobedience"" (1849). It involves deliberately breaking the law as a form of protest against an unjust law or government policy.
2. **Conscientious Objection**: When individuals refuse to comply with laws or policies that they believe are morally wrong, often due to personal convictions or values.
3. **Direct Action**: This term refers to any action taken by individuals or groups to directly challenge or resist a law or authority, often through non-violent means.
4. **Resistance**: A broader term that encompasses various forms of opposition, including civil disobedience, protests, boycotts, and other forms of activism.

Examples of historical movements that involve rebelling against unjust laws include:

* The American Civil Rights Movement (1950s-1960s)
* The Anti-Apartheid Movement in South Africa
* The Arab Spring protests (2010-2012)
* The Indian Independence Movement against British colonial rule
* The Suffragette movement for women's right to vote

26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;"Primary law, also known as statute or legislation, is a source of law that originates from government institutions. The main sources of primary law vary depending on the jurisdiction, but here are some common ones:

1. **Constitutions**: A constitution is the supreme law of a country, outlining its framework and principles. It sets out the powers and responsibilities of government, as well as the rights and freedoms of citizens.
2. **Statutes or Legislation**: Statutes are laws passed by legislative bodies such as parliament, congress, or assemblies. They can be enacted at national, state, or local levels, depending on the jurisdiction.
3. **Regulations**: Regulations, also known as subordinate legislation, are rules made by government agencies under the authority of a statute. They provide more detailed and specific guidance on how to implement the law.
4. **Treaties and International Agreements**: Treaties and international agreements are laws that govern relations between countries or organizations. They are often ratified through domestic legislation.
5. **Enacted Statutes (Ordinances)**: Enacted statutes, also known as ordinances, are similar to regulations but may have more authority in certain jurisdictions.
6. **Common Law**: In common law systems, primary law can also be generated through judicial decisions and the application of precedent.

Additionally, some sources may also include:

27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;"The Black Death, also known as the Plague, is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in present-day Mongolia and China. The exact origin of the plague is still a matter of debate among historians and scientists, but most researchers agree that it emerged from a combination of factors in the 14th century.

There are several theories about how the plague spread:

1. **The ""Rodent-to-Human"" Theory**: One theory suggests that the plague originated from a strain of bubonic plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis) carried by fleas on rodents, such as black rats and their companions, marmots. These rodents were likely infected with the disease while living in the remote regions of Mongolia and China.
2. **The ""Human-to-Human"" Theory**: Another theory proposes that the plague spread directly from person to person through human contact, rather than being transmitted by fleas or other vectors.

**Initial Outbreak (1346-1353)**: The first recorded outbreak of the plague occurred in 1347 in the city of Kaffa (now Feodosiya) on the Crimean Peninsula. This was likely due to a combination of factors, including:

* **Trade and Commerce**: Merchants from China and Central Asia traveled extensively throughout the region, potentially carrying infected fleas or contaminated goods.
* **Climate Change**: A prolonged drought in Mongolia and China may have led to an increase in rodent populations, making it more likely for humans to come into contact with infected fleas.

**Spread of the Plague (1348-1351)**: From Kaffa, the plague spread rapidly throughout Europe via trade routes and human migration. Cities like Constantinople, Genoa, Venice, and Marseille were among the first to be affected, followed by other major urban centers across Europe.

**Impact**: The Black Death is estimated to have killed between 75 million and 200 million people, approximately 30-60% of Europe's population. This pandemic had a profound impact on European society, contributing to significant social, economic, and cultural changes in the centuries that followed.

The exact origin of the plague remains a topic of ongoing research and debate among historians and scientists, but it is widely accepted that Central Asia was the epicenter of this devastating pandemic.";347;6;6;84.5882875919342;14.854653333333333;94.86666666666666
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching;"Paul Baran developed the concept of packet switching, a fundamental technology that enables data communication over computer networks. He proposed the idea in 1964 while working at RAND Corporation.

Packet switching is a method where digital information is divided into small packets and transmitted independently through a network, which then reassembles the packets at their destination. This approach allows for more efficient use of network resources, increased reliability, and greater flexibility compared to traditional circuit-switched networks.

Baran's work on packet switching laid the groundwork for the development of modern computer networks, including the Internet. His ideas were influential in the design of early network protocols, such as the ARPANET, which was a precursor to the modern-day Internet.

29;When was the French and Indian War?;1754?1763;"The French and Indian War, also known as the Seven Years' War, took place from 1754 to 1763. It was a global conflict that involved the British Empire, France, and their respective Native American allies.

In North America, the war began in 1754 with a series of skirmishes between British colonists and French soldiers in the Ohio River Valley. The conflict escalated into a full-scale war, with Britain seeking to expand its territory and eliminate French control over the region.

The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, which marked a significant turning point in world history. France ceded control of most of North America to Britain, while Spain gained control of Louisiana from France.

The consequences of the French and Indian War had far-reaching effects on British politics, economy, and society, ultimately contributing to the American Revolution just over a decade later.

Here's a brief timeline:

* 1754: The war begins with the Battle of Fort Necessity.
* 1755-1760: The conflict escalates into a full-scale war, with battles at Fort Oswego, Fort William Henry, and Quebec.
* 1759-1760: British forces capture Montreal and Quebec City, leading to the eventual surrender of French forces in North America.
* February 10, 1763: The Treaty of Paris is signed, ending the war.

Note that some historians use the term ""Seven Years' War"" to refer to the global conflict that involved multiple European powers, while others prefer the term ""French and Indian War"" to specifically describe the North American theater of the war.";257;7;1;60.93158292770386;14.860370370370376;95.35185185185185
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;"The agents that the immune system detects are known as **antigens**.

Antigens are substances that can trigger an immune response, such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), and other molecules. They can be found on the surface of pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as in tumor cells or foreign substances introduced into the body, such as allergens or toxins.

When antigens enter the body, they are recognized by immune cells called **antigen-presenting cells** (APCs), which process and display fragments of the antigen on their surface. These fragments are then recognized by T-cells and B-cells, which mount an immune response to eliminate the antigen from the body.

So, in summary: antigens are the substances that trigger an immune response, and they are detected by the immune system through a complex process involving antigen-presenting cells, T-cells, and B-cells.";142;10;1;35.83123540878296;14.858838709677414;95.80645161290323
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;"The branch of theoretical computer science that deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship is **Computational Complexity Theory**.

Computational complexity theory studies the resources required to solve computational problems, such as time (number of steps) and space (amount of memory). It also explores the relationships between different computational problems, including:

1. Reducibility: a problem X can be reduced to problem Y if solving Y implies solving X.
2. Equivalence: two problems are equivalent if they have the same complexity.
3. Inclusions: one problem is at least as hard as another.

Some key concepts in computational complexity theory include:

* **P (Polynomial time)**: problems that can be solved in polynomial time, i.e., the number of steps grows polynomially with the size of the input.
* **NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time)**: problems that can be verified in polynomial time by a nondeterministic Turing machine.
* **NP-complete**: problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP.
* **PSPACE (Polynomial Space)**: problems that can be solved using a polynomial amount of space.

Computational complexity theory has far-reaching implications for many areas, including cryptography, optimization, and algorithm design. It helps us understand which problems are tractable and which are likely to remain intractable even with significant computational resources.";211;18;3;51.08429217338562;14.851622222222222;94.84444444444445

33;What percentile of gross domestic product is construction comprised of?;six to nine percent;"Unfortunately, there isn't a straightforward answer to this question, as it depends on the specific economy or region being considered. Construction's share of GDP can vary significantly depending on factors like economic structure, industry mix, and even geographical location.

However, I can provide some general insights based on available data:

1. **OECD countries:** A 2020 OECD report stated that construction value added accounted for around 10-15% of total GDP in most member countries.
2. **United States:** According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), construction's share of nominal GDP was approximately 6.3% in Q4 2020. This translates to about 7.5% when adjusted for inflation (GDP chained 2019 dollars).
3. **European Union:** Eurostat data indicates that construction accounted for around 10-12% of EU28 GDP in 2020.
4. **Developing countries:** In some emerging economies, the construction sector may contribute a larger share to GDP due to rapid urbanization and infrastructure development.

To give you an idea of the range, here are some approximate shares of construction in GDP for different regions or countries:

* United States: 6-8%
* European Union (28): 10-12%
* China: 15-20% (due to massive infrastructure investments)
* India: 10-15%

Keep in mind that these estimates can vary depending on the specific data source, methodology, and time frame considered.

Please note that these figures represent a rough estimate of construction's share in GDP, rather than an exact percentile. I hope this information helps!";234;10;4;60.427072525024414;14.855528301886796;93.75471698113208

42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;"European Union (EU) law, also known as European Community law or EU legal order, refers to the body of laws and regulations that govern the activities of the European Union's institutions, its member states, and citizens. The EU law framework encompasses various areas, including:

1.  **Primary Law**: Treaties are the fundamental sources of EU law, outlining the principles and goals of the Union. Key treaties include the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
2.  **Secondary Law**: Secondary legislation is created by the EU's institutions to implement primary law and provide further details on EU policies. This includes:
    *   **Regulations**: Directly applicable laws that become part of the national legal order without needing any additional implementation steps.
    *   **Directives**: Binding instructions for member states, which must be transposed into their national laws.
    *   **Decisions**: Formal decisions made by EU institutions or bodies, often addressed to specific individuals or organizations.
3.  **Case Law**: The European Court of Justice (ECJ) plays a crucial role in interpreting and developing EU law through its judgments. These cases provide clarification on the application and meaning of EU laws.

European Union Law has several key characteristics:

*   **Supremacy**: EU law takes precedence over national law, as stated in Article 28 TFEU.
*   **Direct Effect**: Certain provisions can be enforced directly by individuals or organizations, even if they conflict with national law (Article 288 TFEU).
*   **Precedence**: ECJ decisions are binding on all member states and their courts.

The scope of EU law is vast, covering areas such as:

1.  **Free Movement**: The free movement of goods, services, capital, and persons between member states.
2.  **Competition Policy**: Regulating anti-competitive practices and promoting fair competition.
3.  **Environmental Law**: Establishing common environmental standards and policies.
4.  **Consumer Protection**: Safeguarding the rights of consumers within the EU.

43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"Philosophers in ancient Greece, particularly Aristotle (384-322 BCE) and his predecessors such as Archytas of Tarentum (c. 400 - c. 350 BCE), used the concept of ""mechanical proportions"" or ""instrumental causes"" to study simple machines.

However, it was the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus (280-206 BCE) who developed a more systematic approach to studying machines using the concept of ""technē"". According to this idea, machines are not just physical devices, but also embody underlying mathematical and conceptual structures. Chrysippus' work on simple machines, such as levers, pulleys, and inclined planes, was later influenced by the development of Stoic logic.

But it's worth noting that the concept that is most closely associated with the study of simple machines in antiquity is actually ""logos"" (λόγος) which was a central idea in ancient Greek philosophy. In this context, logos referred to both reason and rational explanation, as well as the underlying mathematical structure of natural phenomena.

However, I believe you might be looking for something more specific, like the concept of ""mechanism"" or ""instrumental causes"".";170;11;4;44.835209369659424;14.859692307692304;93.07692307692308
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"While public and private schools share many similarities, there are some key differences in their rights and privileges. Here are a few:

1. **Autonomy**: Private schools often enjoy more autonomy than public schools. They can set their own curriculum, policies, and admission standards without government interference.
2. **Funding**: Private schools typically rely on tuition fees, donations, or endowments for funding, whereas public schools receive funding from the government through taxes. This allows private schools to make decisions about how to allocate their resources.
3. **Admission flexibility**: Private schools can set their own admission criteria and select students based on factors such as academic performance, extracurricular achievements, or family background. Public schools, on the other hand, must adhere to strict non-discrimination policies and admit all students within their catchment area.
4. **Freedom from government regulations**: Private schools are generally exempt from some government regulations, such as those related to teacher certification, curriculum standards, and facility inspections.
5. **Ability to charge tuition fees**: Private schools can set tuition fees and charge families for attendance, which allows them to generate revenue and cover costs.
6. **Greater flexibility in hiring staff**: Private schools often have more freedom to hire teachers and staff based on their qualifications and fit with the school's mission, rather than adhering to government-mandated hiring practices.
7. **Access to endowments and private grants**: Private schools may have access to endowments and private grants that can provide additional funding for programs, scholarships, or capital projects.

However, it's essential to note that these ""rights"" come with their own set of responsibilities and challenges. Private schools must still meet certain standards and guidelines to maintain their accreditation and licensure, and they are accountable to their stakeholders, including parents, alumni, and the broader community.

Public schools, on the other hand, have a unique set of rights and responsibilities that prioritize accessibility, equity, and accountability to the public.";312;10;4;72.61547422409058;14.855125000000008;93.1875
