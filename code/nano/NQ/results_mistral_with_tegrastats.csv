0;where did mexico win its independence from spain; On September 27 , 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City , and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was henceforth to be called . The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes . Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown . Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide 's followers . ;" Mexico won its independence from Spain on September 27, 1821. The Independence movement began in 1810 under the leadership of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and continued for over a decade with the involvement of numerous other leaders such as José María Morelos, Vicente Guerrero, and Agustín de Iturbide. The struggle culminated with the Plan of Iguala (August 24, 1821), which was signed by Agustín de Iturbide on behalf of the Spanish forces and José María Morelos y Pavón on behalf of the Mexican insurgents. The Plan of Iguala called for three principles: religion, independence, and unity (Iguala means ""equal"" in English). Mexico officially declared its independence from Spain on September 28, 1821, and Agustín de Iturbide was recognized as the first Emperor of Mexico.";124;8;99;36.48021721839905;8.84675;10.25

6;what type of reaction leads to the production of polymers; The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry . Nylons must specifically include an straight chain ( aliphatic ) monomer . The amide link is produced from an amine group ( alternatively known as an amino group ) , and a carboxylic acid group . The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine , and gives rise to water , the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction . ;" The type of reactions that lead to the production of polymers are polymerization reactions. Polymerization is a process by which large molecules, or polymers, are formed from smaller monomer units. There are two main types of polymerization reactions:

1. Addition polymerization: This type of polymerization involves the repetitive linking of simple monomers to form a chain-like polymer structure. The monomers typically contain at least one unsaturated carbon-carbon bond, such as a carbon-carbon double or triple bond. Examples of addition polymers include polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS).

2. Condensation polymerization: In this type of polymerization, two monomers with reactive functional groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH) or carboxyl (-COOH) groups, react to form a polymer and eliminate a small molecule, often water (H2O). Condensation polymers are typically formed by step-growth or chain-growth mechanisms. Examples of condensation polymers include nylon, polyester, and cellulose.

Both addition and condensation polymerization reactions play crucial roles in the production of various polymers used in everyday products, such as plastics, fibers, resins, and adhesives.";168;10;80;41.16318106651306;14.881027777777778;96.52777777777777
7;when did the one game wild card start; From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series . However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult . The new system was instituted in 1994 ( but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs ) when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league . In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs . In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed . This was the team with the most wins amongst non-division winners . The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league . ; The one-game Wild Card playoff, also known as the Wild Card Playoff Game or Wild Card Round, began in the National Football League (NFL) in the 1970 season. Prior to this, only the two division winners from each conference advanced to the playoffs, with no wild card teams participating. The additional playoff spot was added due to an expansion of the league, bringing the number of teams in each conference up to 14 (28 total). The one-game Wild Card playoff pits the third seed against the sixth seed in each conference, with the higher seed hosting the game.;98;8;181;17.76419973373413;14.879266666666664;91.46666666666667

9;what was the name of shakespeares acting company; The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare . It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare 's playing company , the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , on land owned by Thomas Brend and inherited by his son , Nicholas Brend and grandson Sir Matthew Brend , and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613 . A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed by an Ordinance issued on 6 September 1642 . ; Shakespeare's acting company was called the Lord Chamberlain's Men.

13;how many pages are in the harry potter series; Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93⁄4 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . ;" The Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling, consists of seven books:

1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (309 pages)

14;where is the lava stored in a volcano;" A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth . The molten rock , or magma , in such a chamber is under great pressure , and , given enough time , that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it , creating a way for the magma to move upward . If it finds its way to the surface , then the result will be a volcanic eruption ; consequently , many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers . These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth , and therefore most of those known are close to the surface , commonly between 1 km and 10 km down . ";" The ""lava"" stored in a volcano is actually molten rock, specifically magma, which resides beneath the Earth's surface within the volcano. Magma is formed deep within the Earth by the melting of rocks due to extreme heat and pressure. This molten material collects in magma chambers or reservoirs that are located either directly under or near a volcano. When the pressure inside the magma chamber rises, it can cause an eruption, releasing the molten rock onto the Earth's surface as lava.";81;8;119;16.325592041015625;14.86530769230769;91.61538461538461

16;who led the american occupation of puerto rico during the spanish-american war; Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , ratified on December 10 , 1898 , Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States . Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence . The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island , acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs . Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain . By October 18 , the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain . Those who belonged to the Spanish military who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed `` Porto Rico Regiment '' .

19;when did they stop using knob and tube wiring in homes; Knob - and - tube wiring ( sometimes abbreviated K&T ) is an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings , in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s . It consisted of single - insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities , passing through joist and stud drill - holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes , and supported along their length on nailed - down porcelain knob insulators . Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch , or were pulled into a wall , they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom . The first insulation was asphalt - saturated cotton cloth , then rubber became common . Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength , then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape ( asphalt saturated cloth ) , or made inside metal junction boxes . ; Knob and tube (K&T) wiring was a common electrical wiring method used from the late 1800s until the mid-1900s, but it fell out of favor by the 1950s due to safety concerns and the introduction of more modern, flexible, and insulated electrical wiring systems. However, some houses built before the 1950s may still have knob and tube wiring. If you suspect that a home has K&T wiring, it's essential to consult with an electrician for safety reasons.;77;11;160;17.011667490005493;14.870714285714286;98.07142857142857
20;when did they stop hanging in the us; Hanging has been practiced legally in the United States of America from the nation 's birth , up to 1972 when the United States Supreme Court found capital punishment to be in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution . Four years later , the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling , and in 1976 , capital punishment was again legalized in the United States . Hanging has returned to the states of Washington and New Hampshire . ;" The practice of public hanging as a form of capital punishment was officially abolished in the United States. The last legal execution by hanging took place in Virginia in 1951, although there were reportedly illegally-conducted executions after that date. It's important to note that some states had already phased out this method of execution before 1951. For example, New York abolished hanging in 1825, and electrocution took its place as the state's preferred method of capital punishment until lethal injection became the standard in the late 20th century.

In modern times, capital punishment is carried out through methods such as lethal injection, electrocution, and, in some cases, the firing squad. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the morality and effectiveness of capital punishment in the United States.";127;8;81;24.469048261642456;14.868142857142853;94.0

22;what is the purpose of constructing a calibration curve;" In analytical chemistry , a calibration curve , also known as a standard curve , is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration . A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration ; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown , giving an internal standard . ";" A calibration curve, in scientific contexts, is used to establish a relationship between two variables, typically concentration or intensity (the independent variable) and response (the dependent variable). This curve is constructed by plotting multiple pairs of known values of the independent variable against their corresponding measured values of the dependent variable.

The primary purpose of constructing a calibration curve is to determine the sensitivity, linearity, range, limit of detection, and limit of quantification of an analytical instrument or method. This information is crucial for accurately measuring and interpreting unknown samples in a relevant field, such as chemistry, biology, physics, or engineering.

The calibration curve also serves to correct any systematic errors that may be present in the measurement system, ensuring more accurate results when analyzing samples with unknown concentrations or values. Furthermore, it helps to validate the method and ensure that it is functioning properly, as deviations from the established calibration curve can indicate equipment malfunctions or other issues that need to be addressed.";164;9;73;28.090932846069336;14.863499999999997;93.70833333333333

24;where is the silk road located on a map; The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea . The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia and Europe . The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road ( s ) . ;" The Silk Road was not a single, continuous road but a network of trade routes that connected the East and West from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th century. It spanned across Asia, connecting China (specifically the eastern end of the Silk Road in the city of Xi'an) with regions like the Mediterranean.

On a modern-day map, you can see remnants of the Silk Road passing through China, Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan), Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Iran, and Turkey, and extending into Europe. However, it's important to note that this was an ancient trading network, so modern political boundaries weren't in place at the time.

26;what's the difference between tweedle dee and tweedle dum; Tweedledum and Tweedledee are fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking - Glass , and What Alice Found There . Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom . The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800 . The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways , generally in a derogatory context . ;" Tweedledee and Tweedledum are characters from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" the sequel to ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" While they have many similarities, there are subtle differences between them:

1. Physical Appearance: Tweedledee is characterized by his red nose and his left boot lace unfastened. On the other hand, Tweedledum has a blue nose and his right boot lace unfastened.

2. Personality Traits: Although they are often portrayed as being identical twins, their personalities differ slightly. Tweedledee is generally considered to be more excitable and boisterous, while Tweedledum tends to be quieter and more thoughtful. However, in some versions of the story, these traits can be reversed or blurred.

3. Role in the Story: Both characters play a role in the game of chess that forms part of Alice's adventure in ""Through the Looking-Glass."" They are tasked with capturing the White Queen, but ultimately fail due to their own misunderstandings and Alice's cleverness.

4. Origin: Carroll created the characters as a playful nod to his real-life friends George MacDonald (Tweedledee) and Henry Liddell (Tweedledum), who were brothers. They were the eldest sons of the Dean of Christ Church, Oxford.

These differences may seem minimal, but they are significant in the context of the story and contribute to the characters' unique personalities and dynamics.";213;9;85;46.77716040611267;14.854414634146343;91.65853658536585
27;what do the lyrics mean to lady marmalade; Labelle 's version of `` Lady Marmalade '' was produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham . It was released in November 1974 from Nightbirds , their first album after signing with Epic Records . Patti LaBelle sang lead vocals on `` Lady Marmalade '' with backing vocals being contributed by bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash . The song is best known for the French lyric `` Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? '' ( English : `` Would you like to sleep with me tonight ? '' ) in the refrain . `` Lady Marmalade '' is a song about a prostitute , although Patti LaBelle , the lead female vocal of the band , was completely oblivious to its overall message , saying : `` I did n't know what it was about . I do n't know French and nobody , I swear this is God 's truth , nobody at all told me what I 'd just sung a song about . '' ;" ""Lady Marmalade"" is a song by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. The lyrics are largely about a fictional character called ""Lady Marmelade,"" who is a seductive and mysterious woman working at a Parisian nightclub called the Moulin Rouge. Here are some key interpretations of the lyrics:

1. ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?"" - This line translates to ""Do you want to sleep with me tonight?"" It sets the stage for the song's theme of seduction and passion.

2. ""C'est moi l'que vous chasser dans les rues de mon quartier"" - This translates to ""It's me who will chase you through the streets of my neighborhood."" The speaker is asserting her dominance and independence, suggesting that she is in control of their romantic encounter.

3. ""Lady Marmalade, Voulez-vous boire ce quart de liqueur?"" - This line refers to Lady Marmalade, the character from the song, and asks if she wants to drink a quarter of liquor. The offer of alcohol could symbolize a loosening of inhibitions and an invitation to engage in a more passionate encounter.

4. ""Pour me cherir, mon cher, tu dois boire ce quart de liqueur"" - This translates to ""To love me, my dear, you must drink this quarter of liquor."" The speaker is using the offer of alcohol as a test or condition for their affections.

5. ""Laisse-moi te faire la coucotte dans ma cuisine creole"" - This line translates to ""Let me make you my Creole cocotte (or concubine) in my Creole kitchen."" The speaker is inviting the listener to become her lover and offering an intimate, passionate experience.

Overall, the lyrics to ""Lady Marmalade"" emphasize seduction, passion, and a desire for intimacy, set against the backdrop of a Parisian nightclub and the character of Lady Marmalade.";300;8;171;63.642662525177;14.861428571428572;94.39285714285714

30;types of writs in the constitution of india;  The writ of prohibition is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court . Thus , the higher court transfers the case to itself .   The writ of habeas corpus is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention . If the detention is found to be illegal , the court issues an order to set the person free .   The writ of certiorari is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review , together with all supporting files , evidence and documents , usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court . It is one of the mechanisms by which the fundamental rights of the citizens are upheld .   The writ of mandamus is issued to a subordinate court , an officer of government , or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties .   The writ of quo warranto is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office . Through this writ the court inquires ' by what authority ' the person supports his or her claim .  ;" The Constitution of India recognizes several types of writs that can be issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights. Here are some of the main types:

1. Habeas Corpus: This is a writ to produce the body of a person who is being detained unlawfully or whose whereabouts are unknown. The purpose is to ensure that no one can be deprived of their personal liberty without due process of law.

2. Mandamus: This is a writ commanding or compelling a public official or any other person to perform a legal duty or function that they have failed to perform. It orders the authority to act, or not to act in certain cases, in accordance with the law.

3. Prohibition: This writ prohibits an inferior court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. It is issued when there is an error of law apparent on the face of the record of any proceedings of such a court or tribunal.

4. Quo Warranto: This writ challenges the authority of a person holding a public office to do so, either because they have assumed the position illegally or improperly, or because they are not qualified to hold that office.

5. Certiorari: This is a writ issued by a higher court to a lower court or tribunal to transfer a case and the record of the case from one court to another for the purpose of prosecuting further proceedings therein. It is used when the inferior court exceeded its jurisdiction, acted without authority of law, or refused to exercise its jurisdiction.

6. Quo Warranto in Contempt: This writ is issued when a person has been guilty of contempt of any order, writ, or authority of a court, and the court issuing such an order wants to punish the contemnor for their disobedience.

7. Prohibition in Contempt: This writ prohibits the superior judicial authority from doing an illegal act, or from acting beyond its powers. It is issued when there is a material probability that an inferior court will do an act which is without jurisdiction or is illegal.

8. Mandamus in Contempt: This writ commands a person to perform any public duty which that person has neglected to perform, upon being duly authorized by law to perform it. It is issued when there is a material probability that a public servant will refuse to perform his duty which the law has imposed upon him.

9. Declaratory: This writ seeks a declaration from the court about the existence or non-existence of certain rights, status, or other legal relations without any order for specific performance being made.";437;8;229;75.59085178375244;14.863611940298505;96.59701492537313
31;when can a writ of mandamus be issued; Mandamus ( `` We command '' ) is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a superior court , to any government subordinate court , corporation , or public authority , to do ( or forbear from doing ) some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do ( or refrain from doing ) , and which is in the nature of public duty , and in certain cases one of a statutory duty . It can not be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision . For example , it can not be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made , but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications . ;" A writ of mandamus is a court order that commands a public official or lower court to perform a statutory duty owed to the petitioner. To issue such a writ, several conditions must be met:

1. The person to whom the writ is addressed (the respondent) has a clear, precise, and definite duty to perform an act. This duty arises from a statute, regulation, or constitutional provision.
2. The petitioner has a legal right to receive the act or performance from the respondent. The petitioner must show that they have suffered or will suffer injury for which there is no other remedy.
3. The writ must be issued in the name of the law and not for private interests, as it seeks to enforce public rights.
4. There are no adequate alternatives available to obtain the desired relief.
5. The issuance of the writ will not be disruptive or detrimental to the administration of justice or proper government.
6. The petitioner must demonstrate that there is an absence of sufficient justification for the respondent's failure to perform their duty.
7. It must be shown that the respondent has refused or failed to perform the mandatory duty, or that a substantial question exists as to whether they will do so in the future.
8. The issuance of the writ must not amount to an exercise of judicial power for an improper purpose, such as settling private disputes or compelling political action.

These requirements can vary somewhat depending on jurisdiction, but the general principles outlined above apply broadly across different legal systems.";260;8;148;44.945844650268555;14.861025641025643;95.0
32;what is an honorable discharge from the marines; To receive an honorable discharge , a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for his or her service . Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct , and who complete their tours of duty , normally receive honorable discharges . However , one need not complete a term of service to receive an honorable discharge , provided the reason for involuntary discharge is not due to misconduct . For instance , service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable , regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty , provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards . Similarly , service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force ( RIF ) typically receive an honorable discharge , assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards . ; An Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps is a type of discharge granted to service members who have completed their enlistment or service obligation, or were discharged under honorable conditions due to reasons such as medical disability, reduction in force, or hardship. It signifies that the individual performed their duties satisfactorily and exhibited good conduct during their time in service. This discharge is typically considered favorable, as it allows the former Marine access to various benefits provided by the Veterans Administration (VA), such as education assistance, healthcare, and other services.;91;8;161;16.96097207069397;14.851928571428571;92.28571428571429
33;when did the first us state legalize weed; The legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state - level prohibition in the early 20th century , with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937 . Starting with Oregon in 1973 , individual states began to liberalize cannabis laws through decriminalization . In 1996 , California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis , sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016 . In 2012 , Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for recreational use . ; The first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana was Colorado, on January 1, 2014. Washington State followed suit later the same day. Both states had approved recreational marijuana initiatives (Amendment 64 in Colorado and Initiative 502 in Washington) in November 2012. These legalizations made history as they marked the first time any U.S. state fully legalized recreational cannabis use, sale, and cultivation. Since then, more states have followed suit with varying degrees of legalization. As of February 2021, 15 states, along with Washington D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana.;88;8;90;20.349144458770752;14.86305882352941;91.17647058823529
34;where did the settlers of new hampshire come from;" Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the early 17th century , and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century . Prior to English colonization of the area , it was inhabited by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes . The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower . It set precedents but never grew large . A large - scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies . Friction with the natives erupted in the high - casualty King Philip 's War in the 1670s . Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced ; dissenters were exiled . The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter . Most people were farmers . Businessmen established wide - ranging trade links , sending ships to the West Indies and Europe , and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts . These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 . ";" The settlers of New Hampshire, like many early American colonies, primarily came from England. The region was first inhabited by Algonquian-speaking Native American tribes such as the Abenaki and Pennacook. However, the European settlement began in the late 17th century when English Puritans, fleeing religious persecution, arrived.

The Plymouth Colony, established in Massachusetts in 1620, had a significant impact on the early settlement of New Hampshire. Many early settlers were from the neighboring colony. Other groups included the Mason-Dixon party who came to found Exeter in 1638 and the First Grant Settlements of 1623, which predate Massachusetts but were not officially part of any colony until New Hampshire was established in 1679.

Scots-Irish immigrants also began arriving in the mid-1700s, contributing to the settling and growth of the region. Overall, the early settlers of New Hampshire were largely English and Scottish, with a smaller number of French Huguenots and Dutch settlers.";151;9;208;31.839462995529175;14.847555555555559;94.74074074074075

36;the three pillars of the westphalian constitution of world politics are; Westphalian sovereignty , or state sovereignty , is the principle of international law that each nation - state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory . External powers should not interfere in another country 's domestic affairs . Each state , no matter how large or small , has equal rights to sovereignty . The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states . The United Nations Charter states that `` nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . '' ;"1. Recognition of Sovereignty: This principle states that each state has exclusive authority and jurisdiction over its territory and domestic affairs. It means that no other state or entity can interfere in a sovereign state's internal affairs without the consent of that state.

2. Territorial Integrity: This principle is based on the idea that the territory of a state is inviolable and cannot be altered by force. Any changes to a state's borders must be made peacefully through diplomatic means, such as negotiations or treaties.

3. Non-Intervention: This principle prohibits one state from interfering in the internal affairs of another state. States are expected to respect each other's political systems and social structures, and not attempt to impose their own values or ideologies on other states. These three principles together form the foundation of international relations and help maintain stability and order in the global community.";146;11;87;27.099919319152832;14.860999999999995;95.95652173913044
37;what type of genetic mutation is huntington's disease;" HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , although up to 10 % of cases are due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results . "; Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by a specific type of genetic mutation known as an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene. More specifically, it involves an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence in the IT15 region on chromosome 4. In normal individuals, this sequence repeats between 10-34 times. However, in individuals with HD, it has more than 40 repeats. This abnormal expansion leads to the production of a mutated Huntingtin protein that accumulates and damages brain cells over time, causing the symptoms of the disease.;87;8;191;18.660152912139893;14.868933333333331;94.6
