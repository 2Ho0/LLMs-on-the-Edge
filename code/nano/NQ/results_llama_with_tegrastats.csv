0;where did mexico win its independence from spain; On September 27 , 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City , and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was henceforth to be called . The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes . Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown . Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide 's followers . ;"Mexico won its independence from Spain in the city of Querétaro, on September 27, 1821. However, the fight for independence began several years earlier.

The war for Mexican independence started in 1810, when Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest, issued the Grito de Dolores (Cry of Dolores) on September 16, 1810, calling for a rebellion against Spanish rule. This event is considered the starting point of the Mexican War of Independence.

The war was led by several key figures, including José María Morelos, Guadalupe Victoria, and Agustín de Iturbide, who ultimately allied with the Spanish royalist forces to defeat the other independence leaders.

In 1821, Iturbide's army defeated the last Spanish stronghold in Mexico at the Battle of Azcapotzalco. This victory led to the signing of the Treaty of Córdoba on August 24, 1821, which recognized Mexico as an independent nation and established a constitutional monarchy with Agustín de Iturbide as its first emperor.

However, the treaty also contained provisions that allowed for the reinstatement of Spanish rule if certain conditions were not met. These conditions included the approval of the Mexican Congress and the establishment of a constitutional government.

The Mexican Congress approved the Treaty of Córdoba on October 4, 1821, and Mexico became an independent nation on September 27, 1821, when Iturbide took control of the capital city of Mexico City.

So while Querétaro is not the exact location where Mexico won its independence from Spain, it was the site of a key event in the war for independence: the Convention of Querétaro (also known as the Congress of Querétaro), which took place in 1821 and resulted in the signing of the Acta de Independencia (Act of Independence) on September 27, 1821. This act formally declared Mexico's independence from Spain and established a constitutional government.

It's worth noting that the Mexican War of Independence was not solely a fight against Spanish rule but also an internal struggle for control within the country. The process of gaining independence was complex and involved various factions, alliances, and power struggles.";340;8;99;94.54787373542786;8.837;13.0

3;where did the duffer brothers go to school; The Duffer brothers were born and raised in Durham , North Carolina . They began making films in the third grade using a Hi8 video camera that was a gift from their parents . They attended the Duke School for Children from grades K - 8 , a private suburban school , and then matriculated to the Charles E. Jordan High School , a large Durham public school . They relocated to Orange , California to study film at Chapman University 's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts , where they graduated in 2007 . After writing and / or directing a number of short films , their script for the post-apocalyptic horror film , Hidden , was acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2011 . The brothers directed the film in 2012 , which was released in 2015 . Director M. Night Shyamalan read the script and hired them as writer / producers on the Fox television series Wayward Pines . ;"According to various sources, including interviews and online profiles, here are some details about where the Duffer Brothers (Matt and Ross) attended school:

* **Ridgewood High School**, Ridgewood, New Jersey: The twins attended high school together at Ridgewood High School in their hometown of Ridgewood, New Jersey.
* **Columbia University**: After high school, Matt and Ross both enrolled at Columbia University in New York City. They studied film theory and production as part of the university's graduate program.
* **New York Film Academy**: Before completing their master's degree at Columbia, the Duffer Brothers attended the New York Film Academy (NYFA) to hone their filmmaking skills.

It's worth noting that Matt and Ross began working together on short films while still in high school. Their early collaborations helped shape their storytelling style and led to the development of their breakthrough project, **Stranger Things**, which premiered on Netflix in 2016.";148;8;163;35.7101194858551;14.898064516129024;92.09677419354838
4;main character in to kill a mockingbird book; The story takes place during three years ( 1933 -- 35 ) of the Great Depression in the fictional `` tired old town '' of Maycomb , Alabama , the seat of Maycomb County . It focuses on six - year - old Jean Louise Finch ( nicknamed Scout ) , who lives with her older brother , Jeremy ( nicknamed Jem ) , and their widowed father , Atticus , a middle - aged lawyer . Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill , who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer . The three children are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor , the reclusive Arthur `` Boo '' Radley . The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo , and few of them have seen him for many years . The children feed one another 's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden , and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house . After two summers of friendship with Dill , Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place . Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children , but , to their disappointment , he never appears in person . ;"The main character in the classic novel ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" by Harper Lee is:

**Scout Finch**

However, it's worth noting that Scout is often referred to as the narrator of the story, and her older brother **Jem Finch** also plays a significant role. The story is told through Scout's eyes, and her childhood experiences and observations drive the plot.

But if I had to choose one character as the true main character (i.e., the protagonist), I'd argue that it's:

**Scout Finch**

Here's why: Scout is the central figure around whom the entire story revolves. The novel explores themes of childhood innocence, racial injustice, and the loss of innocence through her eyes. She's a dynamic and curious child who learns valuable lessons about empathy, compassion, and understanding from her father, Atticus.

The character of Scout Finch has become an iconic figure in American literature, symbolizing both the vulnerability and resilience of childhood.";152;8;220;35.71923565864563;14.900096774193537;94.3225806451613

6;what type of reaction leads to the production of polymers; The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry . Nylons must specifically include an straight chain ( aliphatic ) monomer . The amide link is produced from an amine group ( alternatively known as an amino group ) , and a carboxylic acid group . The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine , and gives rise to water , the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction . ;"The production of polymers typically involves a type of chemical reaction known as polymerization. Polymerization is a process in which small molecules, called monomers, combine chemically to form a large molecule, or polymer.

There are several types of polymerization reactions that can lead to the production of polymers:

1. **Addition Polymerization**: This is one of the most common methods of polymerization, where monomers add to each other in a chain reaction, forming a long-chain polymer.
2. **Condensation Polymerization**: In this type of reaction, two or more molecules combine with the loss of a small molecule, such as water, methanol, or ammonia, to form a polymer.
3. **Ring-Opening Polymerization (ROP)**: This involves the opening of a ring-shaped monomer to form a linear polymer chain.
4. **Anionic Polymerization**: This method uses anions (negatively charged ions) to initiate the polymerization reaction.

Some common examples of polymer production through these reactions include:

* Addition polymerization:
	+ Production of polyethylene from ethylene
	+ Production of polypropylene from propylene
* Condensation polymerization:
	+ Production of nylon from adipic acid and hexamethylenediamine
	+ Production of polyester from terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol
* Ring-opening polymerization:
	+ Production of polycarbonate from bisphenol A and phosgene

These are just a few examples, but there are many other types of polymerization reactions that can lead to the production of different polymers.";221;10;80;59.44616484642029;14.893038461538465;93.07692307692308
7;when did the one game wild card start; From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series . However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult . The new system was instituted in 1994 ( but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs ) when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league . In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs . In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed . This was the team with the most wins amongst non-division winners . The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league . ;"I'm not familiar with a specific sports tournament or competition called ""The One Game Wild Card.""

9;what was the name of shakespeares acting company; The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare . It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare 's playing company , the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , on land owned by Thomas Brend and inherited by his son , Nicholas Brend and grandson Sir Matthew Brend , and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613 . A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed by an Ordinance issued on 6 September 1642 . ;"The name of Shakespeare's acting company is not known with certainty. However, it is believed to have been called ""The Lord Chamberlain's Men"" or ""The King's Men,"" depending on the monarch who sponsored them at the time.

* When Shakespeare first formed the company in 1594-95, it was called ""The Lord Chamberlain's Men,"" named after Queen Elizabeth I's chief servant, Robert Cecil, the 1st Earl of Salisbury.
* After James I ascended to the throne in 1603 and became King, the company changed its name to ""The King's Men"" in his honor.

Both names refer to the company being sponsored by the monarch, with ""Men"" indicating that it was an all-male acting company (there were no women actors at this time).

The company's most famous productions include:

* Romeo and Juliet
* A Midsummer Night's Dream
* The Merchant of Venice
* Hamlet

Over time, the company became a renowned theatrical troupe in London, known for its exceptional performances and innovative staging techniques.

11;when was the first pink panther movie made; The Pink Panther is a British - American media franchise primarily focusing on a series of comedy - mystery films featuring an inept French police detective , Inspector Jacques Clouseau . The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963 . The role of Clouseau was originated by and is most closely associated with Peter Sellers . Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards , with theme music composed by Henry Mancini . Elements and characters inspired by the films were adapted into other media , including books , comic books and animated series . ;"A question about a beloved franchise!

The first Pink Panther movie, ""The Pink Panther,"" was released in 1963. It was a comedy film directed by Blake Edwards and starred Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau.

However, it's worth noting that the Pink Panther character itself has a longer history. The character was created by David DePatie and Friz Freleng for a series of animated shorts produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises from 1964 to 1976. These cartoons featured a cartoon pink panther as a charming, clever, and agile thief who often outwitted his human foes.

The live-action film ""The Pink Panther"" (1963) was not directly based on the animated shorts but rather introduced Peter Sellers' iconic character of Inspector Clouseau, a bumbling detective with a penchant for getting into absurd situations. Over time, the franchise expanded to include several sequels, spin-offs, and remakes, often featuring Sellers or other actors in the role of Clouseau.

Here's a brief timeline:

* 1964-1976: The animated Pink Panther shorts are produced.
* 1963: ""The Pink Panther"" (live-action film) is released, starring Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau.
* 1975-1989: Several live-action sequels and spin-offs follow, including ""A Shot in the Dark,"" ""Inspector Clouseau,"" and ""Curse of the Pink Panther.""

12;where does the publisher clearing house money come from; PCH is a direct - marketing company that sells merchandise , magazine subscriptions and operates several prize - based websites . While best known for the sweepstakes and Prize Patrol it uses to promote its magazine subscriptions , the majority of the company 's revenue now comes from merchandise . The company has been selling books , media , jewelry and other consumer items since the 1980s . PCH operates eight websites , including PCH Search and Win , PCH Lotto , PCH Games , PCH Save and Win , and Candystand . ;"A popular question! The Publisher's Clearing House (PCH) sweepstakes has been a staple of American media for decades. Here's where the funds to award cash prizes come from:

**The Business Model:**
Publisher's Clearing House is a direct-mail marketing company that specializes in running sweepstakes, contests, and subscription-based services. The company was founded in 1967 by Jerome M. Fisher, who started with a small mail-order operation. Over time, PCH evolved into a multi-billion-dollar company.

**Revenue Streams:**

1. **Sponsorship Fees:** Large companies pay PCH to be sponsors of their sweepstakes and contests. These sponsors provide cash prizes and product donations in exchange for advertising opportunities, brand visibility, and access to consumer data.
2. **Subscription Sales:** PCH sells subscriptions to various publications, such as magazines and newspapers, which are often bundled with their sweepstakes entries. Subscribers pay a recurring fee (e.g., $10-$20 per month) for these services.
3. **Advertising Revenue:** PCH generates income from targeted advertising within its publications and online platforms.

**How the Money is Awarded:**

1. **Sponsorship Funds:** The cash prizes awarded in PCH contests come directly from sponsorships. These sponsors set aside funds to cover prize costs, which are then allocated according to their agreements with PCH.
2. **Revenue Allocation:** A portion of the subscription fees and advertising revenue generated by PCH is used to fund sweepstakes prizes.

**Transparency:**
While it's true that PCH makes money from sponsorships, subscriptions, and advertising, the company has been criticized for its business practices over the years. Some critics argue that PCH's focus on generating profits from subscribers rather than genuinely awarding cash prizes undermines the integrity of their sweepstakes.

To address these concerns, PCH has implemented various measures to ensure transparency:

* Clear disclosure of sponsorship arrangements
* Regular audits by independent third-party firms (e.g., Ernst & Young)
* Detailed prize payout reports available online

It's worth noting that while some people have been awarded large sums through PCH sweepstakes, the odds of winning are extremely low. According to PCH's official estimates, the chances of winning a major cash prize (over $1 million) are approximately 3 in 6.5 billion.";346;9;93;86.99226427078247;14.887727272727274;92.88311688311688
13;how many pages are in the harry potter series; Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93⁄4 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . ;"The page count of the Harry Potter series can vary depending on the edition and format of the books. However, here is an approximate breakdown of the number of pages for each book in the series:

1. **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone** (published as **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** in the United States):
	* Page count: 320-384 pages (depending on the edition)
2. **Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets**:
	* Page count: 312-352 pages
3. **Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**:
	* Page count: 416-448 pages
4. **Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire**:
	* Page count: 636-688 pages (this one is a bit of a behemoth!)
5. **Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix**:
	* Page count: 766-828 pages (yes, it's long!)
6. **Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince**:
	* Page count: 607-664 pages
7. **Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows**:
	* Page count: 784-832 pages

So, if you're looking for an approximate total page count for the series, here are some estimates:

* The standard paperback editions of the books: around 3,300-3,600 pages
* The hardcover editions of the books: around 4,200-4,800 pages (due to larger font sizes and more elaborate illustrations)
* The audiobook versions of the series: around 145 hours of listening time!

Keep in mind that these are just estimates, and page counts can vary depending on the specific edition or format you're using.";234;9;204;65.50059509277344;14.891965517241385;93.6896551724138
14;where is the lava stored in a volcano;" A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth . The molten rock , or magma , in such a chamber is under great pressure , and , given enough time , that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it , creating a way for the magma to move upward . If it finds its way to the surface , then the result will be a volcanic eruption ; consequently , many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers . These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth , and therefore most of those known are close to the surface , commonly between 1 km and 10 km down . ";"The short answer is: Lava, also known as magma when it's beneath the surface, is not ""stored"" in the classical sense. Instead, it's constantly moving and flowing through a complex system of underground conduits and chambers within the volcanic system.

Here's what happens:

1. **Magma chamber**: Deep within the Earth's crust, typically at depths of 5-15 kilometers (3-9 miles), there's a large, partially molten zone called a magma chamber. This is where molten rock (magma) accumulates and mixes with gases, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide.
2. **Conduits**: The magma chamber is connected to the surface through a network of narrow conduits or pipes, which are made up of fractured rock that provides a pathway for the magma to flow upward.
3. **Vents and fissures**: As magma approaches the surface, it encounters more solidified rock, causing it to slow down and accumulate pressure. This leads to the formation of vents (openings) or fissures (fractured rock) through which the lava can erupt.

When a volcano is not actively erupting, the magma is typically stored in:

* **The upper crust**: The uppermost part of the Earth's crust, where the rocks are under less pressure and temperature.
* **Shallow feeder systems**: Narrow conduits or tubes that connect the magma chamber to the surface. These may be a few kilometers deep.

When a volcano does erupt, the lava flows through these conduits and fissures, often producing a range of spectacular features, such as:

* Lava flows
* Eruption columns
* Pyroclastic flows (fast-moving mixtures of hot ash, gas, and rock)

So, while there's no single ""storage"" location for lava in a volcano, it's constantly circulating through the complex system of conduits and chambers beneath the surface.

I hope this helps clarify where the lava is stored!";295;8;119;73.7500524520874;14.8953076923077;92.8

The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island , acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs . Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain . By October 18 , the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain . Those who belonged to the Spanish military who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed `` Porto Rico Regiment '' . Some took the offer , such as Teófilo Marxuach , a former Lieutenant in the Spanish Army who joined the regiment , and others , such as Capt . Angel Rivero Méndez , declined the offer and retired from the military . ;"During the Spanish-American War, the American occupation of Puerto Rico was led by General Nelson A. Miles (1839-1922), a prominent Union general during the Civil War and later a key figure in the United States Army.

However, after Miles's departure from Puerto Rico on July 31, 1898, the actual leader of the occupation was General William R. Shafter (1857-1934). Shafter led the Fifth Corps of the American army that had invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War and was responsible for leading the occupation forces.

Shafter served as the Military Governor of Puerto Rico from August 1898 to April 1899, when he was relieved by General Miles.";107;12;204;26.271470308303833;14.87772727272727;93.13636363636364

The first Parliament of the World's Religions was held in Chicago in 1893. It was a groundbreaking event that brought together representatives from various religions and spiritual traditions from around the world. The attendees included:

1. **Hindu**: Swami Vivekananda, a prominent Indian philosopher and yogi, is often credited with popularizing Hinduism in the West. He delivered an iconic speech on September 11, 1893, titled ""Sisters and Brothers of America,"" which helped to establish him as a leading figure in American spirituality.
2. **Buddhist**: Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, a Japanese Buddhist scholar, attended the Parliament.
3. **Christianity**: Many Christian denominations were represented, including Anglicans, Catholics, and Protestants.
4. **Judaism**: Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, an American Jewish leader, was among those who participated.
5. **Islam**: The Islamic community was represented by several individuals, but there is no record of any notable figures attending from the faith.

Some notable guests who attended the Parliament included:

* **Leo Tolstoy** (Russian novelist and philosopher)
* **Annie Besant** (British social reformer and spiritualist leader)
* **Madame Blavatsky** (Russian occultist and founder of Theosophy)

The Parliament was a significant event in modern history, as it marked the beginning of interfaith dialogue and understanding. It has since been held several times, most recently in 1993 in Chicago and in 2018 in Toronto.

18;what teams in the nba go to the playoffs;" In September 2015 , the NBA announced changes to the formula used to determine the format of the 2016 NBA Playoffs . The top eight teams in each conference ( East and West ) , ranked in order by win - loss records , qualify for the playoffs . The tie - break criteria for playoff seeding and home - court advantage have also changed ; head - to - head results between the tied teams is the first tie - breaker , and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie - breaker . ";"In the NBA, 16 teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs. Here's how it works:

**Qualification Criteria:**

1. The top 8 teams in each conference with the best win-loss record qualify directly.
2. If there are any tied teams, a series of tiebreakers will be used to determine which team has the higher seed.

**Conference Playoff Teams:**

Here are the teams that typically make the playoffs from each conference:

**Eastern Conference (Atlantic and Southeast divisions):**

1. **Boston Celtics**
2. **Brooklyn Nets**
3. **Philadelphia 76ers**
4. **Toronto Raptors**
5. **Milwaukee Bucks**
6. **Indiana Pacers**
7. **Chicago Bulls**
8. **Miami Heat**
9. **Atlanta Hawks** (play-in tournament)
10. **Washington Wizards** (play-in tournament)

**Western Conference (Northwest, Pacific, and Southwest divisions):**

1. **Los Angeles Lakers**
2. **Golden State Warriors**
3. **Phoenix Suns**
4. **Denver Nuggets**
5. **Dallas Mavericks**
6. **Utah Jazz**
7. **Memphis Grizzlies**
8. **Los Angeles Clippers**
9. **Minnesota Timberwolves** (play-in tournament)
10. **New Orleans Pelicans** (play-in tournament)

Note: The teams that participate in the play-in tournament will depend on their final standings at the end of the regular season.

**Playoff Seeding:**

The top 8 teams in each conference are seeded 1-8 based on their win-loss record, with the team having the best record earning the #1 seed. The seeding for the playoffs is as follows:

* Conference Quarterfinals (4 vs 5, 3 vs 6, etc.)
* Conference Semifinals (1 vs 8, 2 vs 7)
* Conference Finals (Winners of Semifinals)
* NBA Finals (Conference Champions)

19;when did they stop using knob and tube wiring in homes; Knob - and - tube wiring ( sometimes abbreviated K&T ) is an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings , in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s . It consisted of single - insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities , passing through joist and stud drill - holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes , and supported along their length on nailed - down porcelain knob insulators . Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch , or were pulled into a wall , they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom . The first insulation was asphalt - saturated cotton cloth , then rubber became common . Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength , then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape ( asphalt saturated cloth ) , or made inside metal junction boxes . ;"The use of knob-and-tube (K&T) wiring, also known as open-wiring or exposed wiring, was a common practice in residential construction from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century. The exact date when K&T wiring stopped being used varies by location and jurisdiction, but here are some general guidelines:

**Common usage period:** Late 1800s to 1940s

K&T wiring was widely used in homes built between 1880 and 1940. It was a popular choice for several reasons: it was relatively inexpensive, easy to install, and allowed for flexible routing of electrical cables through walls and ceilings.

**Decline and eventual ban:** Mid-20th century (1950s-1970s)

As the demand for electricity grew, so did concerns about fire safety and electrical shock hazards. K&T wiring's exposed nature made it a significant risk factor in home fires and electrocution. To address these issues, many jurisdictions began to phase out K&T wiring.

**Regulatory changes:**

1. **1950s:** The National Electric Code (NEC) introduced stricter guidelines for residential electrical installations, including requirements for insulated wiring and fire-resistant materials.
2. **1960s-1970s:** Many states and local governments passed laws or ordinances prohibiting the use of K&T wiring in new construction. Some jurisdictions also required existing homes with K&T wiring to be upgraded to modern standards.

**Complete phase-out:** 1980s

By the late 1970s and early 1980s, K&T wiring had largely fallen out of favor as a residential electrical installation method. Modern wire insulation materials, such as rubber and PVC, made it unnecessary to use exposed wiring. The NEC (2011 edition) states that K&T wiring is not allowed in new construction or renovation projects.

**Legacy of K&T wiring:** Today

Many older homes still contain K&T wiring, which can pose a significant fire hazard if damaged or poorly maintained. Homeowners and electricians must carefully assess these installations to determine the best course of action for upgrading or replacing them with safer, modern electrical systems.

Keep in mind that the transition from K&T wiring was gradual, and local regulations might have varied by location. If you're dealing with an older home or property, it's essential to consult a licensed electrician to assess any potential hazards and determine the best course of action for updating your electrical system.";362;11;160;90.05319261550903;14.892012499999998;94.95
20;when did they stop hanging in the us; Hanging has been practiced legally in the United States of America from the nation 's birth , up to 1972 when the United States Supreme Court found capital punishment to be in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution . Four years later , the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling , and in 1976 , capital punishment was again legalized in the United States . Hanging has returned to the states of Washington and New Hampshire . ;"The practice of capital punishment by hanging, also known as ""hanging"" or ""execution by hanging,"" has a long history in the United States. The first recorded execution by hanging in the American colonies was in 1628.

However, over time, hanging fell out of favor as the primary method of execution in many states. In the mid-20th century, other methods such as lethal injection and electrocution became more popular.

Here's a rough timeline of when different states stopped using hanging as a primary or sole method of capital punishment:

* **1940s:** Several states begin to abolish hanging as their primary method of execution.
	+ California (1937): Abolishes hanging, citing concerns about the inaccuracy and cruelty of this method.
	+ New York (1939): Abolishes hanging, replacing it with electrocution.
* **1950s-1960s:** More states follow suit:
	+ Illinois (1945): Abolishes hanging, replacing it with lethal gas.
	+ Massachusetts (1947): Abolishes hanging, citing concerns about its inaccuracy and cruelty.
* **1972:** The US Supreme Court rules in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty is unconstitutional due to its arbitrary application. While this ruling doesn't specifically address hanging, it effectively stalls executions nationwide until a later decision.
* **1976:** The US Supreme Court reinstates capital punishment in Gregg v. Georgia, which requires states to establish more precise and consistent sentencing guidelines for the death penalty.
* **1980s-1990s:** Hanging is largely replaced by lethal injection as the preferred method of execution:
	+ Oklahoma (1977): First state to adopt lethal injection as a primary method of execution.
	+ Other states follow, including California, Florida, and Texas.

Today, hanging is no longer used in most US states as their primary or sole method of capital punishment. While some prisons still have gallows for historical or ceremonial purposes, they are not actively used for executions. Lethal injection remains the most commonly used method of execution in the United States, although there are ongoing debates about its constitutionality and effectiveness.

Keep in mind that this is a general timeline, and specific states may have their own unique histories with hanging as an execution method.";345;8;81;84.76059675216675;14.893973333333333;92.62666666666667
21;the day the earth stood still famous phrase; `` Klaatu barada nikto '' is a phrase that originated in the 1951 science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still .

However, the more iconic and often-quoted phrase from this movie is:

**""Klaatu barada nikto!""** (pronounced KLAH-toh BA-ra-dah NEEK-toh)

This phrase has become synonymous with ""stop what you're doing"" or ""cease and desist."" It was used by the alien as a command to his robotic companion, Gort, to stand down and prevent him from destroying humanity.

22;what is the purpose of constructing a calibration curve;" In analytical chemistry , a calibration curve , also known as a standard curve , is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration . A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration ; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown , giving an internal standard . ";"The primary purpose of constructing a calibration curve, also known as a standard curve or calibration graph, is to relate the measured response (signal) from an analytical instrument to the actual concentration or amount of the analyte present in a sample. This relationship enables researchers and analysts to accurately determine the concentration or amount of a substance in unknown samples by comparing their responses against the established calibration curve.

The main purposes of constructing a calibration curve are:

1. **Quantitative analysis**: To allow for the quantitative determination of an analyte's concentration or amount in unknown samples, based on the measured response (e.g., absorbance, fluorescence intensity) compared to known concentrations.
2. **Instrument calibration and validation**: Calibration curves validate the analytical instrument and technique by ensuring that it is accurately measuring the responses expected from known amounts of analytes.
3. **Quality control**: Calibration curves help maintain quality control in laboratories by establishing a benchmark for performance and enabling the detection of any systematic errors or drift over time.
4. **Method development and optimization**: Calibration curves assist in the development and refinement of analytical methods, allowing researchers to optimize parameters such as sample preparation, instrumental settings, and data analysis techniques.

A calibration curve typically follows these steps:

1. Prepare a series of standard solutions with known concentrations of the analyte.
2. Measure the response (signal) from the instrument for each standard solution.
3. Plot the measured responses against the corresponding concentrations.
4. Analyze the resulting curve to determine its equation, which can be linear or non-linear depending on the nature of the relationship.

Once a calibration curve is established and validated, it allows analysts to:

* Determine unknown concentrations by comparing their sample responses against the calibration curve.
* Monitor instrument performance over time, enabling early detection of any issues that may affect accuracy or precision.
* Compare results between different instruments or analytical methods.
* Optimize experimental conditions for improved sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy.

In summary, constructing a calibration curve is an essential step in analytical chemistry to ensure accurate and reliable measurements of analyte concentrations, as well as to validate instrument performance and maintain quality control.";355;9;73;77.0717101097107;14.897411764705893;95.80882352941177

24;where is the silk road located on a map; The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea . The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia and Europe . The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road ( s ) . ;"The Silk Road is a network of ancient trade routes that connected China with the Mediterranean region, and it spans across several countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. Here's where you can find its general location on a map:

**Key regions:**

1. **China**: The Silk Road originates in Chang'an (modern-day Xi'an), Shaanxi Province.
2. **Central Asia**: It passes through modern-day countries such as:
	* Kazakhstan
	* Kyrgyzstan
	* Uzbekistan
	* Tajikistan
3. **Middle East**: It traverses through Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
4. **India** (optional): Some trade routes extended to India, but this is not a primary focus of the Silk Road.

**Major cities:**

Here are some key cities along the Silk Road:

1. **Chang'an (Xi'an), China**: Starting point
2. **Dunhuang, China**: An important oasis city and major stopover
3. **Samarkand, Uzbekistan**: A significant trade center in Central Asia
4. **Bukhara, Uzbekistan**: Another important trading hub
5. **Merv, Turkmenistan**: A vital stopping point for merchants
6. **Persepolis (modern-day Pars), Iran**: The ancient capital of the Persian Empire
7. **Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), Turkey**: One of the final destinations in Europe

**Map view:**

To visualize the Silk Road on a map, imagine a large ""X"" stretching from China to the Mediterranean Sea. The route would roughly follow these coordinates:

* 35° N latitude (China) → 40° N latitude (Central Asia) → 30° N latitude (Middle East) → 40° N latitude (Mediterranean)

Keep in mind that the Silk Road was not a single, continuous road, but rather a network of routes and trade paths. Its exact course varied over time due to changing politics, geography, and climate.

26;what's the difference between tweedle dee and tweedle dum; Tweedledum and Tweedledee are fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking - Glass , and What Alice Found There . Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom . The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800 . The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways , generally in a derogatory context . ;"A question about one of Lewis Carroll's most beloved creations!

In ""Jabberwocky,"" a nonsense poem in ""Through the Looking-Glass"" (1871), Tweedledum and Tweedledee are two identical twin brothers. They are described as being:

""...two little men, with red hot eyes,
Who were always quarrelling, and fighting for the bill.""

Carroll himself explained that he made them identical twins to illustrate the idea of ""the difference between twins is not so very great"" (from his notes on the poem).

So what's the difference between Tweedledee and Tweedledum? Well, according to Carroll, there isn't really one. They are interchangeable characters, with no distinct personalities or characteristics.

However, in some interpretations and adaptations, Tweedledee is sometimes portrayed as slightly more energetic or mischievous than Tweedledum, while the latter might be depicted as a bit more bumbling or dim-witted. But these distinctions are not inherent to the original poem and are largely subjective interpretations.

Ultimately, their identical appearance and interchangeable roles in the poem serve to highlight the absurdity and illogic of some linguistic and cultural concepts – much like the rest of ""Jabberwocky"" itself!";181;9;85;47.0159227848053;14.896878048780481;96.3170731707317
27;what do the lyrics mean to lady marmalade; Labelle 's version of `` Lady Marmalade '' was produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham . It was released in November 1974 from Nightbirds , their first album after signing with Epic Records . Patti LaBelle sang lead vocals on `` Lady Marmalade '' with backing vocals being contributed by bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash . The song is best known for the French lyric `` Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? '' ( English : `` Would you like to sleep with me tonight ? '' ) in the refrain . `` Lady Marmalade '' is a song about a prostitute , although Patti LaBelle , the lead female vocal of the band , was completely oblivious to its overall message , saying : `` I did n't know what it was about . I do n't know French and nobody , I swear this is God 's truth , nobody at all told me what I 'd just sung a song about . '' ;"A classic song! ""Lady Marmalade"" is a 1974 disco hit by Labelle, an American R&B trio. The song was written by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan, and its lyrics are somewhat open to interpretation. However, I'll try to break down the possible meanings behind them.

**The Song's Narrative**

The lyrics describe a woman named Lady Marmalade, who is a high-class prostitute or courtesan in a Parisian brothel (according to Crewe). The song's narrator approaches her and offers to buy her services. He attempts to persuade her with gifts, money, and flattery.

**Themes and Symbolism**

The lyrics are somewhat ambiguous, but they can be interpreted as a commentary on:

1. **Sex work and objectification**: Lady Marmalade is portrayed as an object of desire, a commodity that can be bought and sold. The song's lyrics may be seen as reinforcing the notion that women's bodies are objects for men's pleasure.
2. **Seduction and temptation**: The narrator is seducing Lady Marmalade with promises of wealth and luxury. The song's catchy melody and harmonies make it difficult to resist the allure of the subject matter.
3. **Exoticism and escapism**: The song's use of a French setting (Paris) and the character's exotic name creates an air of mystery and allure, transporting listeners to a world of fantasy.

**The Role of Lady Marmalade**

Lady Marmalade can be seen as a symbol of:

1. **Feminine power and agency**: Despite being portrayed as a sex worker, Lady Marmalade is depicted as having some level of control over her situation. She's willing to accept the narrator's offers but also seems aware of her own worth.
2. **The objectification of women**: On the other hand, Lady Marmalade can be seen as an exemplar of the way society treats women: as objects for men's pleasure and gratification.

**Interpretation by Labelle**

In various interviews, the members of Labelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash) have discussed the song's meaning. According to Patti LaBelle, the song was intended as a commentary on the way women are objectified and commodified in society.

However, it's worth noting that some critics have argued that the song perpetuates negative stereotypes about sex work and reinforces problematic attitudes towards women. Despite these criticisms, ""Lady Marmalade"" remains a beloved disco classic.

29;when does one flew over the cuckoos nest take place; One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and deep changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America . The 1960s began the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization , an act that would have affected the characters in Kesey 's novel . The novel is a direct product of Kesey 's time working the graveyard shift as an orderly at a mental health facility in Menlo Park , California . Not only did he speak to the patients and witness the workings of the institution , but he voluntarily took psychoactive drugs , including mescaline and LSD , as part of Project MKUltra . ;"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place in a psychiatric hospital, specifically at a state mental institution called Oregon State Hospital, in the fictional town of McMurphyville (which is modeled after Salem, Oregon).

The novel was written by Ken Kesey and published in 1962. However, based on various references to the time period, it can be inferred that the story takes place in the early 1950s.

Here are some clues that suggest the setting:

1. The narrator mentions that McMurphy has just been sent from a work farm in California, which was common during this era.
2. The novel contains references to the 1946 Hatch Act, which prohibited state and local governments from engaging in partisan politics.
3. Nurse Ratched's style of management is typical of the bureaucratic systems prevalent in the United States at that time.

Given these clues, it is likely that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest takes place around 1950-1952, although the exact year is not specified in the novel.";165;10;122;39.18059468269348;14.899735294117637;95.26470588235294
30;types of writs in the constitution of india;  The writ of prohibition is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court . Thus , the higher court transfers the case to itself .   The writ of habeas corpus is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention . If the detention is found to be illegal , the court issues an order to set the person free .   The writ of certiorari is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review , together with all supporting files , evidence and documents , usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court . It is one of the mechanisms by which the fundamental rights of the citizens are upheld .   The writ of mandamus is issued to a subordinate court , an officer of government , or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties .   The writ of quo warranto is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office . Through this writ the court inquires ' by what authority ' the person supports his or her claim .  ;"Here are some types of writs mentioned in the Constitution of India, specifically under Article 32 and Article 226:

1. **Habeas Corpus**: This writ is issued to prevent unlawful detention or imprisonment of a person. It ensures that a person is not detained without due process of law.
2. **Mandamus**: This writ is issued to compel a public authority or official to perform a specific duty or function. It ensures that the government and its officers act according to their duties.
3. **Prohibition**: This writ is issued to prevent a public authority or official from acting beyond their powers or jurisdiction. It ensures that the government and its officers do not overstep their limits.
4. **Quo Warranto**: This writ is issued to inquire into the legality of an office or position held by a person. It ensures that only qualified persons hold public offices.
5. **Certiorari**: This writ is issued to review and quash a decision made by a lower court or tribunal. It ensures that decisions are fair, just, and in accordance with the law.
6. **Prohibition (Writ of prohibition)**: This writ is similar to mandamus, but it prevents a public authority from acting beyond their powers rather than compelling them to act.
7. **Mandamus (Specific Performance Writ)**: This writ is issued to compel a person or authority to perform a specific duty or function.

These writs are mentioned in the Constitution under Article 32 and Article 226, which provide for the following:

* Article 32: Right to Constitutional Remedies - The Supreme Court has the power to issue writs, orders, and decrees for enforcing fundamental rights.
* Article 226: Power of High Courts to issue certain writs - High Courts have the power to issue writs, including the ones mentioned above.

These writs play a crucial role in ensuring that the government and its officers act according to their duties, and that citizens' fundamental rights are protected.";319;8;229;73.97267079353333;14.8995076923077;94.93846153846154
31;when can a writ of mandamus be issued; Mandamus ( `` We command '' ) is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a superior court , to any government subordinate court , corporation , or public authority , to do ( or forbear from doing ) some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do ( or refrain from doing ) , and which is in the nature of public duty , and in certain cases one of a statutory duty . It can not be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision . For example , it can not be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made , but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications . ;"A Writ of Mandamus (Latin for ""We command"") is a judicial order that requires a government official, public body, or administrative agency to perform a specific act or duty that they have refused to do. Here are some situations when a Writ of Mandamus can be issued:

1. **Failure to Act**: When a public authority fails to take action on a matter within their legal jurisdiction, and there is no other remedy available, the court may issue a writ of mandamus compelling them to act.
2. **Discretionary Power Abuse**: If a government official or agency abuses their discretionary power, such as making an arbitrary decision that is not supported by law, a writ of mandamus can be issued to rectify the situation.
3. **Non-Compliance with Statute or Regulation**: When a public authority fails to comply with a statute or regulation, and there are no other remedies available, a writ of mandamus may be used to enforce compliance.
4. **Administrative Delay or Inaction**: If an administrative agency or government official unreasonably delays or refuses to take action on a matter within their jurisdiction, the court may issue a writ of mandamus to compel them to act promptly.

To obtain a writ of mandamus, the following conditions typically need to be met:

1. **Lack of Alternative Remedies**: There must not be any other effective remedy available, such as an appeal or administrative review.
2. **Clear Legal Duty**: The public authority must have a clear legal duty to take specific action on the matter in question.
3. **Refusal or Failure to Act**: The public authority must have refused or failed to act on the matter despite having a clear legal duty to do so.

A writ of mandamus is usually issued by a higher court, such as an appellate court or supreme court, after reviewing the lower courts' decisions and determining that there are exceptional circumstances justifying its issuance.";316;8;148;70.47436857223511;14.900775862068972;97.58620689655173
32;what is an honorable discharge from the marines; To receive an honorable discharge , a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for his or her service . Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct , and who complete their tours of duty , normally receive honorable discharges . However , one need not complete a term of service to receive an honorable discharge , provided the reason for involuntary discharge is not due to misconduct . For instance , service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable , regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty , provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards . Similarly , service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force ( RIF ) typically receive an honorable discharge , assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards . ;"An Honorable Discharge (HD) from the United States Marine Corps is a type of military separation that indicates a Marine has served their country with distinction and fulfilled their contractual obligations. It's considered one of the most desirable forms of military discharge.

To qualify for an Honorable Discharge, a Marine typically meets certain criteria:

1. **Service completion**: The Marine completes their enlistment contract or is released early due to exceptional circumstances.
2. **No disciplinary actions**: There are no significant disciplinary infractions on record, such as courts-martial, non-judicial punishment (NJP), or other adverse administrative actions.
3. **Good conduct**: The Marine demonstrates good behavior and adherence to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) during their service.

Types of Honorable Discharges:

1. **Honorable Discharge (HD)**: The standard HD is issued when a Marine completes their contract without any issues or disciplinary actions.
2. **Honorable Discharge with Good Conduct Medal**: This discharge is awarded to Marines who serve an honorable period, typically 3-6 years, and demonstrate exceptional conduct.

Benefits of an Honorable Discharge:

1. **Eligibility for Veterans Administration (VA) benefits**: HD recipients are eligible for VA education, healthcare, and other benefits.
2. **Civilian job preferences**: Many employers prefer hiring veterans with Honorable Discharges due to their discipline, work ethic, and skills gained during military service.
3. **Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits**: HD recipients may be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, which provides education assistance, housing stipends, and other benefits.

To obtain an Honorable Discharge, a Marine typically follows these steps:

1. **Notify their unit or chain of command**: Inform their commanding officer about their intention to separate from the Corps.
2. **Complete separation paperwork**: Fill out necessary forms (e.g., DD Form 214) to document their military service and reason for discharge.
3. **Receive a final evaluation**: The Marine's unit will conduct an evaluation to determine if they qualify for an Honorable Discharge.

Keep in mind that an Honorable Discharge can be affected by various factors, such as medical discharges, injuries, or other circumstances. If you're a Marine looking to leave the Corps with an HD, it's essential to consult with your unit and chain of command to ensure you meet the necessary criteria.";360;8;161;90.03831124305725;14.894962499999997;95.375
33;when did the first us state legalize weed; The legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state - level prohibition in the early 20th century , with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937 . Starting with Oregon in 1973 , individual states began to liberalize cannabis laws through decriminalization . In 1996 , California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis , sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016 . In 2012 , Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for recreational use . ;"Colorado and Washington were the first two US states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. On November 6, 2012, voters in these two states approved ballot measures that allowed adults to possess up to an ounce of marijuana and grow a limited number of plants.

However, if you're thinking about medical marijuana, the first state to do so was California, which passed Proposition 215 in 1996. This measure allowed patients with certain conditions to use marijuana for medicinal purposes with a doctor's recommendation.

So, while it's hard to pinpoint an exact ""first"" state to legalize weed, I can provide you with some key milestones:

* **California (1996)**: First US state to pass a medical marijuana law (Proposition 215).
* **Washington and Colorado (2012)**: First two states to legalize recreational marijuana for adults.
* **Alaska (2014), Oregon (2014), and Washington, D.C. (2015)**: Next wave of states to legalize recreational marijuana.

Nowadays, many more US states have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use, with ongoing efforts to expand legalization at the federal level.";172;8;90;42.12749934196472;14.89156756756756;94.10810810810811
34;where did the settlers of new hampshire come from;" Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the early 17th century , and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century . Prior to English colonization of the area , it was inhabited by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes . The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower . It set precedents but never grew large . A large - scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies . Friction with the natives erupted in the high - casualty King Philip 's War in the 1670s . Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced ; dissenters were exiled . The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter . Most people were farmers . Businessmen established wide - ranging trade links , sending ships to the West Indies and Europe , and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts . These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 . ";"The settlers of New Hampshire came from various parts of England, primarily from the counties of Yorkshire, Nottingham, and Kent. Here's a brief overview:

**Early Settlers (1623-1640)**

* **Massachusetts Bay Colony**: Many of the early settlers of New Hampshire were also members of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, which was established in 1629. These colonists were primarily from England's East Midlands and South Coast.
* **Dorchester, England**: The town of Dorchester, located on the River Frome in Dorsetshire (now Dorset), was a major source of settlers for New Hampshire. In fact, the first settlement at Dover, New Hampshire, was established by Thomas Littlefield, a Dorchester native.
* **Yorkshire and Nottingham**: Other early settlers came from Yorkshire and Nottingham, including the towns of Sculcoates, Howden, and Beverley.

**Major Waves of Settlement (1640-1700)**

* **Migration from Massachusetts Bay Colony**: As the Massachusetts Bay Colony expanded, many residents migrated northward to New Hampshire, attracted by the area's fertile soil, abundant timber, and natural resources.
* **Immigrants from England**: Between 1640 and 1700, an estimated 1,500 English immigrants arrived in New Hampshire, primarily from Yorkshire, Nottingham, Kent, and other parts of southeastern England.

**Notable Settlements and Influential Families**

* **Portsmouth**: Founded by John Mason, a prominent investor in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Portsmouth became one of the largest towns in early New Hampshire.
* **Dover**: Established by Thomas Littlefield and his family from Dorchester, Dover remained an important hub for trade and commerce.
* **Families like the Gilmans**: The Gilmans, who settled in Exeter, were among the earliest settlers of New Hampshire. They, along with other influential families like the Phippses (from London) and the Wheelers (from Yorkshire), played significant roles in shaping the colony's early history.

Keep in mind that these settlements were not limited to these specific areas or families rather, they represent some of the most notable influences on New Hampshire's early development. Over time, the population expanded through natural growth, immigration from other parts of Europe and England, and trade with neighboring colonies.";332;9;208;86.56229972839355;14.893051948051946;95.31168831168831

36;the three pillars of the westphalian constitution of world politics are; Westphalian sovereignty , or state sovereignty , is the principle of international law that each nation - state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory . External powers should not interfere in another country 's domestic affairs . Each state , no matter how large or small , has equal rights to sovereignty . The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states . The United Nations Charter states that `` nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . '' ;"The Westphalian Constitution of World Politics, which was established by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, is considered to be a foundational document for the modern international system. It has three main pillars:

1. **Sovereign Equality**: This principle asserts that all states (also known as nations) are equal and have the same rights. This means they have sovereignty over their territories, and no higher authority can dictate terms without their consent.

2. **Non-Interference**: The principle of non-interference holds that one state should not interfere in the internal affairs of another state. This includes refraining from military intervention, economic coercion, or other forms of political interference.

3. **Territorial Integrity**: Also known as non-aggression, this pillar ensures that each state has the right to maintain its territorial integrity and sovereignty without external encroachment or aggression.

These pillars have been foundational in shaping international relations since their inception at Westphalia and continue to influence how nations interact with one another today.";158;11;87;37.69144821166992;14.893272727272716;95.39393939393939
37;what type of genetic mutation is huntington's disease;" HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , although up to 10 % of cases are due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results . ";"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a specific type of genetic mutation known as an **expansion of a trinucleotide repeat**.

More specifically, HD is caused by a **CAG repeat expansion** in the Huntingtin gene (HTT), which is located on chromosome 4. Normally, the HTT gene contains 10-26 CAG repeats however, individuals with HD have an abnormally large number of CAG repeats, typically more than 36.

This trinucleotide repeat expansion leads to a toxic protein product, huntingtin, that accumulates in neurons and causes cellular damage and death. The expanded repeat is unstable and prone to further expansion during DNA replication, which can lead to a gradual increase in the number of CAG repeats over generations.

The specific characteristics of the genetic mutation in HD are:

1. **Autosomal dominant inheritance**: A single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease.
2. **Trinucleotide repeat expansion**: The CAG repeat expansion is the underlying cause of the disease.
3. **Anticipation**: The number of CAG repeats tends to increase with each generation, leading to earlier onset and more severe symptoms in younger individuals.

The genetic basis of HD has been extensively studied, and it is considered a paradigm for understanding other neurodegenerative diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions, such as Fragile X syndrome and spinocerebellar ataxia.";218;8;191;55.66753673553467;14.895387755102039;92.83673469387755

The United Nations Charter `` reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights , and dignity and worth of the human person '' and committed all member states to promote `` universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion '' . ;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) applies to all individuals, regardless of their nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. This means that it applies to:

1. **All people everywhere**: The UDHR is a global document that recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of every human being, wherever they may live.
2. **Citizens and non-citizens alike**: It protects the rights of individuals who are citizens of a country, as well as those who are not (e.g., refugees, stateless persons).
3. **Children and adults**: The UDHR recognizes the rights of children and adolescents to special protection and care.
4. **Men and women**: The Declaration emphasizes the equal rights and freedoms of both men and women.

Specifically, the UDHR applies to:

1. **Individuals**: Every person has inherent dignity and inalienable rights, regardless of their individual circumstances or situations.
2. **Groups and communities**: In addition to protecting the rights of individuals, the UDHR also recognizes the importance of promoting and protecting the rights of groups and communities, such as indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, women, and children.
3. **States**: The Declaration emphasizes the responsibility of States (governments) to protect and promote human rights within their territories.
4. **International organizations**: The UDHR also applies to international organizations, such as the United Nations, which have a role in promoting and protecting human rights worldwide.

In summary, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a universal document that recognizes the inherent dignity and worth of every human being, regardless of their nationality, place of residence, or any other status.";262;10;93;62.990973234176636;14.897763636363637;95.34545454545454

42;where does the saying spotty muldoon come from; Spotty Muldoon , a fictional character created by Peter Cook , and featured in his 1965 song The Ballad of Spotty Muldoon ;"After some digging, I couldn't find any definitive sources explaining the origin of ""Spotty Muldoon"" as a phrase or expression. It's possible that it's a regionalism, a colloquialism, or even a made-up term.

However, I did stumble upon a few potential leads:

1. **Literary connections**: In 1968, the British satirical magazine Private Eye published a poem by Alan Coren called ""Spotty Muldoon."" The poem poked fun at Brian Mulroney (not Muldoon), the then-Canadian prime minister. Could this be the starting point for the phrase's popularity?
2. **Ireland and politics**: During World War II, an Irish politician named Seán MacEntee was sometimes referred to as ""Spotty"" in the press due to his alleged association with a certain individual. Another theory suggests that ""Spotty Muldoon"" might have been a nickname for Eamon de Valera's rival, Seán T. O'Kelly.
3. **Nonsense verse and rhyming slang**: It's possible that ""Spotty Muldoon"" is simply a playful creation of a poet or songwriter who wanted to use the phrase in a humorous context.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any conclusive evidence linking these theories together or providing an authoritative explanation for the origin of ""Spotty Muldoon.""

43;when did the word robotics first appear in print;" According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov , in his science fiction short story `` Liar ! '' , published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction . Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term ; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics , he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots . In some of Asimov 's other works , he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround ( Astounding Science Fiction , March 1942 ) . However , the original publication of `` Liar ! '' predates that of `` Runaround '' by ten months , so the former is generally cited as the word 's origin . ";"According to various sources, including dictionaries and linguistic references, the word ""robotics"" first appeared in print in 1942.

The term was coined by the Czech playwright Karel Čapek (1880-1938) in his science fiction play ""R.U.R."" (Rossum's Universal Robots), which premiered on January 25, 1920. However, it wasn't until the 1940s that the word started gaining traction.

The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records the first written evidence of ""robotics"" as being in a 1942 article by Bertram Brookes, an American engineer and writer, titled ""Robotics—A New Word?"" which was published in the journal ""Mechanical Engineering"".

Merriam-Webster's dictionary also lists 1942 as the date when ""robotics"" first appeared in print.";108;9;138;32.23670744895935;14.898821428571422;94.92857142857143

If you're thinking of the Ramblers, Loyola-Chicago did have a remarkable run in 2018, making it to the Final Four but losing to Michigan in the semifinals.

However, if you meant Loyola Marymount, their men's basketball team has not won an NCAA championship. The Lions did make it to the Elite Eight in 1987 and had some notable seasons in the 80s and 90s under coach Paul Westhead, but they have not been able to capture a national title.

If you can provide more information or clarify which school you're thinking of, I'd be happy to try and help!";137;8;69;34.917964696884155;14.896066666666659;95.66666666666667
45;who played the baby in i love lucy; Enrique Alberto Ricardo IV , `` Little Ricky , '' is a fictional character from the American television series I Love Lucy ( 1951 -- 57 , with Ricky Jr. becoming a part of the show as of his birth in 1953 ) and The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour ( 1957 -- 60 ) . Little Ricky was played by a number of actors , including James John Ganzer , twins Richard and Ronald Lee Simmons , twins Michael and Joseph Mayer and , most notably , Keith Thibodeaux , billed as Little Ricky . Although the I Love Lucy announcer and the opening credits of The Lucy - Desi Comedy Hour gave his stage name as `` Little Ricky '' , in his post-Lucy acting career , particularly his four - year irregular stint on The Andy Griffith Show , he was billed as Richard Keith . ;"A classic TV trivia question!

The babies in I Love Lucy were actually three different sets of twins who were used to play the roles of Little Ricky, Lucy and Ricky Ricardo's baby boy. Here are their names:

1. Keith Thibodeaux's brother: Keith was a regular on the show and his twin brother, Michael Thibodeaux, played Ricky Jr. for about 9 months.
2. Lori and Lucy Ann Ball: These two twin girls were used for many episodes and played Little Ricky in some scenes.

However, if you're thinking of the baby who appeared in the famous ""Lucy Goes to the Hospital"" episode (Season 4, Episode 3), it was actually Keith Thibodeaux's brother, Michael.";113;8;149;27.996903657913208;14.902291666666665;91.75
46;where does publisher clearing house money come from; Publishers Clearing House ( PCH ) is a direct marketing company that markets merchandise and magazine subscriptions with sweepstakes , and prize - based games . ;"The age-old question about Publisher's Clearing House (PCH) and their massive cash prizes!

Publisher's Clearing House is a multi-level marketing company that offers sweepstakes and contests to consumers. While they claim to be ""giving away"" millions of dollars in prize money, the origins of these funds are often shrouded in mystery.

Here's what I've found:

**Revenue sources:**

1. **Advertising revenue:** PCH earns significant income from advertising on their website, social media channels, and promotional materials. Advertisers pay PCH to display ads alongside their sweepstakes and contests.
2. **Affiliate marketing:** PCH partners with various companies to promote their products or services through affiliate links. When a user clicks on these links and makes a purchase, the company that referred them earns a commission. This revenue stream is likely substantial for PCH.
3. **Product sales:** PCH offers a range of products, including magazines, books, and online services. While not as significant as their advertising or affiliate marketing revenue, product sales contribute to their overall income.
4. **Sponsorships:** Large corporations often sponsor PCH's contests and sweepstakes in exchange for promotional opportunities.

**Where the prize money comes from:**

While PCH doesn't directly reveal where the prize money originates, there are some clues:

1. **In-house funds:** It's possible that a portion of the prize money is generated from PCH's own revenue streams, such as advertising and product sales.
2. **Sponsor contributions:** Corporate sponsors may contribute to the prize pool as part of their sponsorship agreements with PCH.
3. **Insurance companies:** Some reports suggest that insurance companies are involved in providing the funds for PCH's prizes.

**Criticism and controversies:**

Over the years, PCH has faced numerous criticisms and lawsuits regarding their sweepstakes and contests:

* Many have questioned the legitimacy of PCH's giveaways, suggesting they're designed to promote sales rather than genuinely award cash.
* Critics argue that winners are often selected based on their likelihood of purchasing products or services from PCH, rather than true randomness.
* Lawsuits have been filed claiming that PCH engages in deceptive practices and exploits vulnerable consumers.

While the exact origin of PCH's prize money remains unclear, it's evident that their primary revenue streams come from advertising and affiliate marketing. The company's business model relies on attracting large numbers of participants to create a sense of excitement and urgency around their sweepstakes and contests.";384;8;26;92.25435972213745;14.893548780487798;94.9390243902439

49;ukraine starts liquidation of legendary aircraft manufacturer antonov; On 19 July 2017 , the Ukrainian government approved the liquidation of Antonov 's assets , starting with closing down three factories in Kiev and Kharkiv . The State Concern `` Antonov '' ( a business group , created in 2005 from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management ) will be liquidated as a residual corporate entity . Antonov State Company , Kharkiv State Aviation Manufacturing Enterprise and Plant No 410 of Civil Aviation were transferred under the management of another state - owned concern Ukroboronprom in 2015 . Antonov State Company continues to function as an enterprise . ;"I'm not aware of any information that suggests Ukraine has started the liquidation of Antonov, the legendary aircraft manufacturer. In fact, Antonov is still a well-known and respected company in the aviation industry.

Antonov Design Bureau (ADB) is a Ukrainian aerospace company based in Kiev, Ukraine. The company was founded in 1946 and has been designing and manufacturing large cargo planes, including the An-225 Mriya, which holds multiple world records for payload capacity and size.

It's possible that you may have come across incorrect or outdated information about Antonov's financial situation or operations. If you could provide more context or details about what you're referring to, I'd be happy to try to help clarify the situation.

Antonov has continued to operate over the years, albeit with some challenges due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the company faced financial difficulties but received support from the Ukrainian government to continue its operations.

In December 2022, Antonov announced that it was working on a new military transport aircraft, the An-178M-CU, which is designed for the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. This suggests that the company remains active in design and production activities.

If you have any specific questions or concerns about Antonov's current situation or operations, I'll do my best to provide more information or point you in the direction of reliable sources.";225;8;108;51.94964528083801;14.898666666666664;94.73333333333333
