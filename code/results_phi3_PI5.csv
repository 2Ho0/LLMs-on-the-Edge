3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava);"Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. Magma originates beneath Earth' end in its mantle layer, while volcanic eruptions can bring surface-originating lava into this process as well. When these molten materials crystallize below ground within the Earth to form intrusive igneous rocks like granite and gabbro, they cooled slowly allowing large mineral grains (crystals) to grow. This is due to insulation provided by overlying rock which retains heat in these subterranean environments. On contrast, extrusive or volcanic igneous rocks such as basalt and rhyolite form on the Earth' surface after a volcanic eruption when lava cools quickly resulting in fine-grained crystals due to swift cooling rates which do not allow large mineral grains time for growth.

The process of forming igneous rocks can be summarized as: Magma or Lava forms → Cooling and Solidification occurs, leading to the formation of Igneous Rocks. The texture (grain size) is a key characteristic that indicates whether an igneous rock crystallized slowly underground (intrusive/plutonic rocks such as granite or gabbro), characterised by large mineral grains due to slow cooling, or quickly on the Earth's surface following volcanic eruption resulting in fine-grained texture seen in extrusive/volcanic igneous rock types like basalt and rhyolite.";0.003604391;2.260472081;0.013;2.242;346;15;13

10;What is the worlds largest academic and private library system?;Harvard Library;"The world's largest academic and private library system as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2decade, known for its extensive catalog of books, periodicals, manuscripts, recordings, maps, drawings, prints, photographs, computer files, fungus culture specimens, graphic materials, sound ephemera (e.g., scrapbooks), and other formats is the Harvard Library system in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The university library itself consists of 75 physical libraries with an estimated total collection size exceeding eleven million items including books, periodicals, manuscripts, recordings, images, films, and maps as well as its digital holdings that surpass fifteen petabytes consisting largely of full-text documents available online.

Harvard Library is not just one library but a complex network comprising the Harvard University Libraries (HUL) which consist primarily of individual libraries across the university's campuses in Cambridge and Allston, as well as its offsite collections including rare books and manuscripts housed at separate facilities such as Houghton Library. The system also includes consortium partnerships with other academic institutions to provide access for their users through shared resources like interlibrary loan services, digital repositories, specialized bibliographic databases, research centers focused on specific subjects or disciplines across various campuses and libraries around the world which greatly expands its reach globally.

Harvard's collections are diverse covering all human knowledge areas from ancient history to contemporary scholarship in virtually every discipline of study possible - reflecting Harvard's role as an educational institution dedicated not only towards academic excellence but also intellectual curiosity and exploration, fostering a culture that values the pursuit of truth through rigorous research.

13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France;The Huguenots, or French Protestants during the Reformation era in Europe (primarily between the mid-16th and late 17th century), were predominantly concentrated in regions such as Normandy, Poitou, Saintonge, Aunis, Maine, parts of Alsace, Franche-Comté, Burgundy, Savoy, Brittany, Dauphiné, Provence, and the Rhône River Valley. Many Huguenots sought refuge in these areas due to religious differences with Catholic France at that time under Louis XIV's rule which often led to persecution of Protestants known as The Edict of Nantes was revoked leading many more fleeing into exile particularly England, Switzerland and South Africa but also the US.;0.003576593;1.146009378;0.012;1.129;167;12;7
14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;"Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies or sea walnuts, are a phylum of marine invertebrates within the animal kingdom. They're characterized by their gelatinous bodies and eight rows of ciliated plates (called 'ctenes') that run across their surface these unique features help them move through water with a distinctive shimmering effect created by their bioluminescenz, which is why they are often referred to as ""sea sparkles.""

The phylum contains over 100 species and can be found in oceans worldwide, typically near the surface where sunlight penetrates. Despite their name being associated with 'jellyfish,' comb jellies do not have a sting and are generally harmless to humans unless accidentally ingested when swimming or diving due to their gelatinous texture which can be mistaken for food by unaware divers.

Ctenophores exhibit radial symmetry, meaning they're capable of being divided into similar halves along any longitudinal plane passing through the center—a common trait among many aquatic invertebrates such as jellyfish and starfish (echinoderms). They are also known for their unique mode of feeding most comb jellies prey on small animals like copepods, larvae, and other tiny sea creatures.

Interestingly, ctenophores have a remarkable ability to regenerate lost body parts in some cases—an adaptation that likely helps them survive when injured by predators or accidents while swimming through the water column with their eight rows of combs lined with tentacles for capturing prey.

Despite being one of nature's most beautiful creatures, ctenophores face numerous threats due to habitat loss and environmental changes—threatening not just themselves but also other animals that rely on them as part of the marine food chain like fish larvae or small shrimps. As such, conservation efforts are needed for their continued survival in our oceans’ ecosystems!";0.003601184;2.816786633;0.011;2.801;453;9;9
15;Along with non-governmental and nonstate schools, what is another name for private schools?;indipendent;"Another term often used to refer to both governmental/non-governmental and nonstate schools collectively as alternative or independent schools. This can encompass a wide range of educational institutions that offer alternatives outside the traditional public school system, including but not limited to parochial (religiously affiliated) private schools often found in religious communities such as Catholic schools for instance.

Please note that 'nonstate' isn't typically used terminology within English-speaking education systems and it might lead to confusion however, you could potentially interpret this term broadly as referring to nonpublic or independent educational institutions not directly controlled by governmental entities but operating independently under various forms of private ownership.";0.003653542;1.103019336;0.015;1.083;147;19;3

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;"Imperialism, the policy of extending a country's power by acquiring territories or influencing areas beyond its own borders, has historically been administered through various methods. These include direct colonial rule where an empire establishes full control over another territory and governs it directly economic exploitation which involves manipulating local economies to benefit the imperial power often coupled with political influence without formal governmental structures being imposed by that foreign entity, as seen in neocolonialism.

There are also indirect methods such as protectorates or puppet governments where an empire influences another region but allows for some form of local rule under the guidance and control of imperial representatives spheres of influence which define areas within a country that is ostensibly independent, yet heavily influenced economically and politically by foreign powers without formal administration. Lastly, cultural imperialism extends beyond direct governance into soft power tactics such as spreading language, culture, education, religion, etc., to gain indirect control or at least significant sway over the colonized region's identity and values.";0.003983509;1.573618458;0.011;1.557;231;9;11
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"The development and improvement upon the laws of motion by various scientists took place over several centuries. After Newton published his three fundamental laws in ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687, it wasn't until about a century later that significant advancements were made based on them.

Notably, the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw important refinements due to Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity (published between 1905-1915) which redefined concepts related to mass, energy, time, and space that Newtonian mechanics couldn't fully explain. The special theory of relativity in particular significantly impacted the understanding of motion at speeds approaching the speed of light—something classical physics struggled with.

However, it wasn’t until around mid-20th century when Quantum Mechanics started to blend into mainstream Physics which led scientists like Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger to reinterpret Newton's laws on a quantum scale in the framework of path integral formulation or Schrödinger equation respectively. 

Nonetheless, for most everyday purposes – such as predicting the trajectory of an object falling under gravity - these modifications are unnecessary Newtonian mechanics suffice and provide accurate results within its applicable domain (i.e., non-relativistic speeds). So it depends on what 'improve' means in this context, but for practical purposes like calculating projectile motion or objects moving at a constant speed where relativistic effects are negligible - Newton’s laws still stand strong and accurate after centuries of use without significant modifications. 

In summary, while there have been refinements over time to account for high speeds (relativistic physics) and subatomic particles (quantum mechanics), the core principles established by Sir Isaac Newton in his three Laws of Motion continue to serve as a strong foundation within their applicable domain without significant modifications.";0.00352927;2.838698177;0.018;2.816;440;17;4
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"Islamism seeks to incorporate certain principles and values associated with the religion of Islam, particularly those found in its scriptures like the Quran and Hadiths. These ideas are not merely spiritual but also pertaining to social life, aiming for a society based on Islamic law or Sharia that governs many aspects:

1. Social Justice - In an effort to ensure fairness within societies by promoting principles like equality among men (especially between genders), almsgiving and charity as forms of wealth distribution the sharing of resources for social welfare such as zakat, poor relief or public funds funded from these Islamic sources.
   
2. Legal System - An Islamist society would have laws that are derived directly from Quranic teachings (Halakha) and Hadiths which cover every aspect of life including family law, criminal justice system etc. These might include punishments for crimes such as theft or adultery according to sharia principles – though these practices can vary widely among different Islamist groups due to differing interpretations of religious texts.
   
3. Political System - The political structure would be rooted in Islamic concepts like ummah (the global community united by faith), and the idea that leaders should govern according to Sharia principles with an emphasis on justice, fairness as advocated for in Hadiths and other religious texts. Some groups might even seek a caliphate or some form of government ruled directly by Islamic laws where decisions are made based upon Quran-inspired codes of conduct that promote social harmony within the society underpinned by mutual respect among its members, fostering peace and brotherhood (asbab al-nuzul).
   
4. Cultural Life - Music, dress code etc., might be regulated to uphold traditional Islamic norms or practices as per Hadiths that mention restrictions on music for fear of it leading people astray from the path of rightedeousness and moral good (Tahrim al-Nafs).
   
5. Education - The education system would be based around teaching Quran, Arabic language to read scriptures correctly along with Hadith literature as primary sources for Islamic knowledge imparting religious values like Taqwa or Aynamu into students alongside secular subjects if the society allows it and emphasizes on learning by heart.
   
6. Economy - An economy in an Islamist system would prioritize trade based upon principles of fairness, honesty (adl), avoiding oppression like Riba i.e., interest-based transactions which are prohibited under Sharia law encouraging businesses to operate ethically and socially responsibly as part of promoting Tazkiyah or the purification from evil through good deeds – a concept that extends into economic practices too.
   
7. Personal Life - Islamic teachings would guide personal matters such as marriage, divorce rules (talaq), child rearing along with familial responsibilities and respect for parents which are considered sine qua non in many Hadiths these principles form an integral part of life under the influence of any political ideology.
   
8. Environmental Ethics - Islamism also encourages stewardship over nature, as humanity is seen to be trustees on Earth (Khalifah) for Allah and His creatures – a notion that promotes an environmental ethic in line with the teachings of Quran about respecting creation.
   
Remember this description represents one perspective among many interpretations within global Islam, all varying based upon different historical contexts, cultural backgrounds and ideological inclinations towards certain principles or belief systems which are integral to their understanding of life under the influence of any political system like Islamism.";0.003823755;4.874365778;0.005;4.864;825;15;5
20;When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?;Following a referendum in 1997;"The Parliament of Scotland, also known as the Scottish Estates or simply The Estates, is a historical body that evolved into what we now know as the modern devolved Scottish Parliament. However, if you are referring to its most recent incarnation following re-establishment after being dissolved in 1963 due to the creation of a UK parliament with combined powers (and later becoming part of Scotland's governance within this unitary system), it convened for the first time on May 1, 1999. This was following referendums held earlier that year where Scottish voters decided they wished to establish their own Parliament again after being a constituent country in Great Britain alongside England and Wales since then (but under different governance).

However, if you're asking about the historical parliament which existed before 1707 when Scotland merged with England to form Great Britain, it would not be correct or possible as such an entity did not exist after that point.

21;The immune system protects organisms against what?;disease;The immune system primarily guards the body against infectious agents and pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. It recognizes and eliminates these foreign entities to prevent illness or disease infection through a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work collectively as an immune response system. Additionally, the immune system also fights against malignanctum - cancerous tumors within our body by identifying and destroying abnormal cells before they develop into harmful growths or spread to other parts of the organism (a process known as metastasis).

22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;"As an AI, I don't have access to real-time databases or specific financial data from individual years such as exact figures for a group labeled with this moniker. However, according to the Forbes Billionaire List published by Fortune magazine in August 2008 and other similar reports, there were indeed wealthy individuals whose net worth was estimated around $1 million USD or more at that time (although it is rare for someone's entire assets to equate precisely to one million dollars).

To get an estimate of their combined wealth during a specific year like 2008 would require detailed financial data, which typically isn't disclosed due to privacy concerns. However, if you are referring metaphorically or generally speaking about people whose personal net worth was around the $1 million mark in that timeframe and interested only in their aggregate wealth as a concept (not individual figures), it is important to note this amount can fluctuate significantly based on market conditions like economic recessions, stock market performance, real estate values among others. The 2008 global financial crisis led by the collapse of Lehman Brothers had substantial effects not just in America but globally and could have impacted many net worths around $1 million or slightly more if they were heavily invested therein.

In essence, without specific data on individuals who exactly met this wealth bracket during that year (which is virtually non-existent), it's impractical to calculate a precise aggregate amount of combined wealth for the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008. However, if we had similar categorizations from credible financial reports or publications as were available during that time (like Forbes Billionaire List) with anonymized data regarding individuals earning between $500k and $1M annually within the U.S., a rough estimate could perhaps be inferred by comparing their wealth to those in similar categories, acknowledging significant variables like stock market performance impacting these figures greatly.

23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973;"The 1973 oil crisis began on October 6, 1973. It started when the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC), led by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, imposed an oil embargo against nations perceived as supporting Israel during the Yom Kippur War in which several Middle Eastern countries fought among themselves over territorial disputes. Among these were Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan who sought to regain control of historically significant territories taken by Western colonial powers or allied states after World War I.

The embargo targeted not only the nations supporting Israel—such as Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands (referred to collectively in the oil industry as 'the Club of Seven') but also those seen more favorably toward Egypt or Iraq: Spain, Taiwan, South Korea, and Singapore. The impact was devastating for several Western countries that were heavily reliant on Middle Eastern petroleum imports prices quadrupled globally by late 1973 as oil production in the embargoed nations plunged from its regular peak of over thirty million barrels per day to a mere six. The crisis had lasting economic and political consequences, prompting shifts towards energy conservation, efficiency improvements within automobiles (including better fuel economies), alternate forms of transportation like bicycles or public transit in urban areas as well as geopolitical changes which recalibrated the global balance of power.";0.003958936;2.163213139;0.011;2.147;339;9;3
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries;"The term ""Norman"" refers to the people who settled in what is now France, known as Normandy. Their history begins after their Viking ancestors started raiding and settling in various parts of Europe around the late 8th century but became more established by this time under a feudal system that included local governance structures like fiefs granted to vassals for military service.

The Normans were officially recognized as such after they signed the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte with King Charles III of France in 911 AD, which granted them land in Rouen and beyond - this is when we can begin referring to their specific cultural identity that blended Viking heritage with Frankish elements. They established a distinct Norman culture by the mid-10th century, often seen as French Normandy'thy period of history started after they became vassals under Charlemagne in 754 AD and continued into various stages until the region was absorbed into France proper following its annexation during the time surrounding Charles VIII’s invasion in 1492.

Their prominence is best remembered for their conquest of England in 1066, under Duke William II (later known as William I or ""William the Conqueror""), and from then onwards they played a significant role not only within France but across Europe with events like the Norman invasion of Sicily.

So to answer your question: The Normans in their distinct cultural sense were established by 911 AD, following their agreement with Charles III of France which marked them as settlers and vassals who maintained a Viking heritage while also adopting elements of Frankish culture during the procession from Danish homeland.";0.003460497;2.344172442;0.011;2.329;374;8;5

26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;"Primary laws come from several key legal instruments. These include:
1. Constitutions - Serve as a supreme form of governance, dictating how each country should operate and what rights its citizens possess. Examples could be US' Declaration of Independence or France’s Constitution.
2. Statutes - Enacted by legislative bodies (like Parliament), these are laws that regulate society on local issues such as business practices, criminal behavior etc. For example, the UK Businesses Act is a statute. 
3. Case law/Precedents – Decisions made in court cases can become binding precedents for future similar situations based upon legal principles established by previous decisions (like 'stare decisis'). Examples include Brown v Board of Education or Donoghue vs Stevenson which have greatly shaped US and UK common laws. 
4. Regulations – Rules made by governmental agencies with legislative authority to guide how specific statutes are implemented, for instance rules regarding environmental protection in the United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations.  
5. Treaties/International Law - Agreements between countries which can take precedence over a nation' end laws when conflicts arise (like WTO agreements).";0.003629822;1.767054777;0.017;1.745;263;9;6

The war began when colonial disputes between British American settlers and French colonists over land claims led to a series of escalated skirmishes starting with the Battle at Fort Necessity in 1754, which is often cited as one of its key events.;0.004021927;0.931885301;0.016;0.911;128;8;5
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;The agents that an individual's immune system detects and responds to, such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi, can be referred to collectively as pathogens. When these foreign invaders breach the body’th defenses, typically through physical barriers like skin or mucous membranesor via inhalation into respiratory passages, they come under scrutiny by our immune system's various components which include cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. The adaptive branch of the immune response specifically targets these pathogens using specialized mechanisms tailored to effectively neutralize or eliminate them from the body without harming its own tissues—a testament to the complex interplay between host defense strategies and microbial evasion techniques that have evolved over time.;0.003669016;1.095833404;0.005;1.086;186;12;2
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;The field in theoretical computer science that is concerned with the classification of computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, complexity classes (like P, NP-complete), as well as various reductions between these classes, is known as Computational Complexity Theory. This area studies how resources like time and memory are required for algorithms solving different types of problem instances or 'instances' within a certain class. It also investigates the implications if problems can be solved faster (i.e., in polynomial-time) than we currently believe possible, which could potentially have profound impacts on numerous fields including cryptography and database management systems among others.;0.003981658;0.921250921;0.014;0.902;132;21;4
32;Which coastline does Southern California touch?;Pacific;Southern California, part of the U.S. state located in the southernmost portion of the Pacific Coastal Belt and bordered by Mexico to the southwest across the Gulf of Mexico, is adjacent to one major body of water – it borders not just any coastline but specifically touches up against the expansive stretch known as the Pacific Ocean. The region's diverse beaches such as Venice Beach in Los Angeles County or Malibu along Ventura and Santa Monica Counties are renowned for their proximity to this vast ocean, offering a clear illustration of Southern California’ end touching upon its coastline by one major body of water: the Pacific Ocean.;0.003691684;0.834889994;0.006;0.823;144;7;1
33;What percentile of gross domestic product is construction comprised of?;six to nine percent;"I'm sorry, but as an AI developed by Microsoft with a knowledge cutoff in early-2023 and without the ability to provide real-time data or specific country references, I cannot give you current exact figures. However, generally speaking, the construction sector can vary significantly across different countries based on factors like economic size, development stage, government policies, population growth, urbanization rates, etc.

To find out what percent of GDP is comprised by construction in a specific country or region as of my last update, you would typically look at reports from national statistics agencies (like the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis for the United States) or international organizations such as the International Monetносиa). These entities often publish detailed economic accounts that include data on sectoral contributions to GDP.

Here's a general idea about how construction fits into an economy: In developing countries, construction might be one of the more significant contributors due to rapid urbanization and infrastructure development needs. Meanwhile, in developed nations with well-established infrastructures, its contribution could be lower as services dominate economic output.

To get precise numbers for a specific country or time period, consider consulting national statistical agencies such as:

1. United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the National Income and Product Accounts database for U.S.-specific data 
2. The Office for National Statistics in the UK with their publications on GDP by industry sector
3. Eurostat, which provides EU-wide statistics including construction's share across member states within my knowledge cutoff date.";0.003967959;2.122722032;0.011;2.106;343;13;4

Victoria follows closely after and typically leads Sydney-based economies in terms of contribution towards overall Australian economic output when considering its population size relative to other large cities like Melbourne itself (the capital city). However, I should note that exact rankings can vary yearly based on numerous factors including business cycles, policy changes, demographic shifts, etc. For the most accurate and recent data, it is best to refer directly to sources such as ABS publications or economic analysis reports by reputable institutions like The Australian National University (ANU).;0.003483274;1.150674018;0.02;1.126;166;12;1
35;Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?;Antigone;"The specific work by Sophocles where the theme of civic duty can be inferred is his tragedy ""Antigone."" Although it's not typically categorized under direct acts of protest or overt demonstrations for social change, one could interpret Antigone'thinking and action as a form of civil disobedience. In her defiance against King Creon's decree forbidding the burial of her brother Polynices (Antigone herself being exiled from Thebes), she upheld divine law over human decrees, which can be seen as an act challenging societal norms and laws for moral reasons.

In ""Antigone,"" Sophocles portrays Antigone's actions within a tragic framework—her defiance leads to her death along with other characters in the play due to escalating conflict between divine law, human law, family loyalty, and civic responsibility. While it may not be an intentional act of civil disobedience directed towards societal reform as understood today, Antigone's stand can certainly inspire reflection on individual moral duty versus state authority—a concept at the heart of modern discussions about protest movements like Occupy Wall Street and Standing Rock.

In a more contemporary sense, Sophocles’ exploration of civil responsibility in his works has influenced political thought throughout history. His portrayal of characters that act out their beliefs against oppressive systems resonates with the principles underlying social justice advocacy seen today within movements such as Black Lives Matter and BLM (Black Lives Matter), which seek to protest systemic racism, promote police reform, challenge unjust laws, demand greater accountability from institutions of power like corporations involved in environmental destruction or wealth accumulation by a select few.

The principles embodied within Sophocles' plays—especially Antigone—resonate with the core tenets driving such social movements today: confronting established authorities and norms, refusing to be silent about perceived moral wrongdoings in society, questioning societal values that sustain inequality or environmental exploitation. These themes are central components of what defines modern protest movements like BLM—their aim is not only personal justice but social reform through civil disobedience and activism against deeply ingrained systemic issues a legacy carrying forward from the dramas crafted by Sophocles in ancient Athens over two millennia ago.";0.003841534;3.239216678;0.014;3.22;523;12;2
36;University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?;various academic disciplines;"The University of Chicago is renowned for its contributions to various fields, particularly the social sciences. One significant development was spearheaded by sociologists and economists from this institution who made substantial advancements within urban sociology during the mid-20th century. The scholars at the University of Chicago developed pioneering theories regarding cities as complex organisms that are constantly evolving through interaction among its residents, social institutions, and external forces.

Prominent figures such as Robert Park, Ernest Burgess, and Roderick Dilts were instrumental in founding this approach. They focused on the ""concentric zone"" model of urban development which explains city growth with five zones emanating from a central business district: (1) Central Business District or Transition Zone (2) The Working-Class Homes, First Circles (3) Residential Dormitories near the City Center 4) Far Outer Suburbs of the Greater Metropolis and Commuter Towns.

Following World War II in America's urban centers during a time known as The Great Migration saw an influx of African Americans from rural areas to cities, leading researchers at Chicago University like Jane Addams delved into social issues such as poverty which brought about the development of Casework Method. This method was designed for case workers who were dealing with individuals in difficult situations and aimed at providing them a structured approach towards understanding their clients' experiences while developing effective strategies to aid those people better, thereby significantly improving community welfare services delivery mechanisms nationwide.

The University of Chicago also played an essential role within the field of political science by hosting one-time intellectual gatherings known as ""Chicago Schools"" in 1932 and again from 1940 to 1960, which included influential scholars like Robert H. Bates who developed important theories on economic systems using behavioral economics principles based around game theory concepts that became foundational for many contemporary studies within this field today.

In the realm of education and philosophy, University of Chicago's notable contributions were led by Mortimer Adler whose work laid groundwork towards classical liberalism in American educational discourse through his development as an educator at Columbia College where he founded a rigorous curriculum for undergraduate students emphasizing critical thinking skills.

The university also has been heavily involved with the study of religious institutions and their role within society, particularly Christian ethics scholars such as Bernard E. Barre to have delved deeply into this topic during his tenure at Chicago's Divinity School in Theological Studies Journal where he authored numerous significant works regarding faith-based communities’ social impact throughout history leading towards contemporary issues involving religion and society like global religious conflicts, secularization trends or interfaith dialogues.

In sum, the University of Chicago scholars played a vital role across various academic disciplines - sociology, economics, political science, education philosophy & Christian ethics through their pioneering work which has significantly shaped modern understanding in these respective fields and continue to inspire future generations today while maintaining an enduring legacy that continues contributing towards social progress worldwide.";0.003682877;4.185309132;0.018;4.162;685;12;4
37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;"Imperialism, as a term and concept primarily relates to the expansion of nations for economic or political control. The etymology can be traced back mainly through two languages: Latin and Greek. It is derived from ""imperium,"" meaning authority, command, rule in classical Latin and its plural forms were used to denote domination over large territories by a single empire - hence the formation of words like 'empire' itself (Latin imperii).
Moreover, some aspects also link imperialism with Greek influence. Notably, Alexander the Great’s conquest attempts across Asia and Egypt which formed one version of Hellenistic Imperialism as he sought to spread his own culture throughout these vast territories - a form of cultural imperialism that influenced many regions even after centuries following their fall into Roman control (thus entering Latin). Therefore while it's not entirely rooted in an ancient language, the term 'imperialism' owes much linguistically and historically to both Ancient Greek and Latin.";0.004047908;1.404329223;0.023;1.376;215;14;1
38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP);The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was not directly established by a United Nations organization but rather through collaboration between two key bodies within the U.N. system: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which is a specialized agency, and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), focusing specifically on environmental issues including climate change. They formed an agreement to establish IPCC in 1988 as part of their joint commitment to understanding human impacts on global weather patterns due to greenhouse gas emissions. While these two entities played a major role, they operated under the broader framework and support provided by several United Nations member states who committed to its establishment, functioning mainly through governmental representatives rather than being an independent UN organization itself.;0.003702894;1.127093416;0.012;1.11;167;9;19

- Abnormal cells like cancerous tumors that can be detected and eliminated by the immune system
- Foreign substances such as pollen grains causing allergic reactions when they enter our bodies. In this scenario, a specific group known as antibodies or immunoglobulins are produced which help in neutralizing these foreign invaders.

43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"In ancient times, the Greeks were among the first groups of people who studied and documented principles related to simple machines. The philosopher Archimedes is famously attributed with understanding these concepts well before modern science developed a more precise vocabulty for such mechanisms (like ""mechanical advantage""). 

Archimedes' principle can be applied when discussing the mechanical aspects of levers, pulleys and other simple machines. The basic idea was that using certain arrangements could amplify human effort or reduce physical force required to perform a task - these are essentially early understandings of what we now term ""mechanical advantage"". Archimedes even famously asserted this in his treatise on the lever, where he claimed:

""Give me a place to stand and withstand any load."" 

The ancient Greeks didn't have precise tools or equations for calculating mechanical advantages as we do today. However, through empirical observations and reasoning, they were able to understand how these machines worked - an understanding that laid the groundwork for all future study in this area of mechanics.";0.004509286;1.505438461;0.016;1.483;232;13;4
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"Private schools often enjoy certain rights and privileges not available to their public counterparts. Here are some of these key differences:

1. **Tax Exemptions**: Many, but not all, non-profit or religiously affiliated private schools receive tax exemptions on income they generate from tuition fees because the majority of educational institutions in America operate as charities under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, for-profit education companies are not eligible for this relief and must pay federal corporate taxation rates on their income unless they can find a different legal basis to obtain similar exemptions (e.g., being organized under Section 501(c)(6) or as an educational trade or business).

2. **Operational Independence**: Private schools are typically not subjected to the same regulations and standards imposed on public institutions by government bodies, like school districts or state departments of education. This results in them having more operational independence - they can set their own policies without seeking approval from external authorities (although this is changing with many states increasing oversight over all types of schools).

3. **Curriculum Choices**: Private institutions often have the freedom to design and implement a curriculum that reflects specific religious or pedagogical belief systems, unlike public schools which are required by law (in most cases) to follow an approved state-mandated curriculum guided primarily by local school districts. This allows private institutions not only autonomy in content creation but also the ability to teach particular ideologies that may be contrary to secular or mainstream beliefs prevalent within public education systems, which is generally restricted under the separation of church and state doctrine unless it's a religiously affiliated institution where such activities can align with faith-based teaching.

4. **Enrollment Policies**: Private schools often have greater autonomy in terms of their enrolment policies than public institutions, allowing them to impose criteria for admission that may prioritize certain demographic groups or religious beliefs (for example). As a result, they can maintain homogenous student bodies with shared cultural values and practices. Public education systems are required by law not only to promote but also protect the rights of students belonging to minority communities hence their policies often seek diversification in lineage representation on campus - an ideal that is largely upheld within private institutions due to lesser stringent regulations regarding admissions processes, although they too must abide by civil rights laws.

5. **Staff Hiring Practices**: While both public and private schools are restricted from discriminating in hiring practices based on race, gender or religion under various federal and state anti-discrimination laws (like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act), some critics argue that these constraints may impact how educational leaders within government institutions operate. Private education systems often have more leeway when it comes to staffing decisions as they are not beholden to such restrictions, although many do choose to follow similar ethical practices in alignment with societal norms and expectations for inclusivity.

6. **Staff Payment Method**: As non-profits or charities (if religiously affiliated), most private institutions generally receive funding through donations from patrons, parents of students rather than government subsidies provided to public schools - this may result in differing standards for staff wages and benefits. 

7. **Governance Structure**: Private school governance tends to be more decentralized with significant input (and often control) coming from the institution's governing body, which typically consists of parents or a board composed primarily of community members rather than political representatives like local government officials are in public institutions - this can contribute to differing administrative policies and decision-making processes between private and public schools.

8. **Fee Structure**: Parents often directly bear the financial responsibility for sending their children to a non-public institution, as opposed to receiving state funded education via local taxes in governmental institutions - this can lead differing levels of accessibility amongst various economic demographics when choosing between public and private school.

9. **Length/Extent**: Some religiously affiliated schools may operate with a different calendar compared to the academic year system adopted by most U.S public educational systems, often incorporating additional spiritual components into their teaching structure or schedule that go beyond conventional academics in order to instill faith-based values and teachings among students - this autonomy allows them to implement unique programs (like daily prayer hours) not typically found within the curriculum of governmentally run schools.

10. **Student Behavior Policies**: Private institutions may impose stricter behavioral standards in accordance with their specific educational philosophy, which can differ from public school policies as per Title IX regulations aimed at preventing discrimination on the basis of sex within education programs and activities - these rules are typically upheld by government entities.

Despite differences between private and public institutions regarding various aspects mentioned above (and more), it is essential to acknowledge that many schools operate with overlapping principles while working towards their distinctive missions in the pursuit of providing quality education for students across diverse backgrounds - irrespective of type or funding model.";0.003420757;7.165160742;0.013;7.148;1144;13;4
45;What is the largest stadium in Australia?;Melbourne Cricket Ground;"The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) in Victoria, Australia holds the title for being one of the world's most famous and historically significant sports venues.

46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters;Ctenophores, also known as comb jellies or sea walnuts, are marine invertebrates belonging to their own phylum apart from the more commonly recognized animal groups. They inhabit all of our world'ty oceans and can be found typically at depths ranging from tidal pools near shore down to great oceanic trenches (up to 100 meters deep). However, some species do venture into brackish waters like estuaries or even freshwater environments during spawning seasons. It is important to note that while most ctenophores prefer marine habitats with ample sunlight for photosynthetic symbiotic organisms (zoochlorellae and endosymbionts), some species, notably Mnemiopsis leidyi, have been recorded in freshwater environments.;0.003541323;1.39585294;0.02;1.371;181;9;2

48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;"The European Union (EU) has a bicameral parliament, consisting of two main bodies: The directly elected European Parliament and the unelected Council of the European Union. Each body plays distinct roles in EU law-making process with their primary function being representation of citizens' interests to ensure democratic legitimacy for decisions affecting them.

1) European Parliament - It is a supranational legislative institution representing 705 members from all over Europe, directly elected by citizens every five years using proportional representation in national elections or through lists provided by political parties at the EU level during ""EU-elections."" The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) discuss and approve or reject laws proposed by the European Commission. They also have oversight over its activities, scrutinizing policies to ensure they are in line with citizens' interests.

2) Council of the European Union - It is composed of government ministers from each member state but operates differently than a national cabinet because it represents different departments (ministers). The composition reflects the principle that while everyone enjoys equal rights, every country has not an equal say in the EU’s decision-making. Decisions made by Council are based on qualified majority voting and also require consent of the European Parliament for adoption into law or approval through unanimous vote when required. 

These two bodies work together to create laws that must be agreed upon before they can take effect across all EU countries, representing an important part of its legislative process called Ordinary Legislative Procedure (OLP).";0.003554457;2.195188939;0.008;2.182;336;15;9
49;The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?;Westminster;"As of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, the Scotland Act does not specify a particular location or institution for which devolved areas of competence are ""not to be"" within UK reservations. Instead, it operates under the principle that only matters explicitly reserved by Westminster – as listed in Schedule 5 and subsequent schedules – fall outside Scottish legislative authority. This is known as constitutional convention rather than a legally binding rule codified into writing at one specific location or institution. However, if there were to be an amendment of the Scotland Act providing for such geographical specification, it would need to occur through formal legal changes made by UK Parliament and then incorporated back into Scots law following ratification processes as per existing legislation on devolution in Scotland (The Devolution Reference Guide).

It's essential that any potential amendment maintaining the balance between Scottish autonomy and reserved matters align with broader constitutional principles, especially given recent discussions around changing this aspect of UK governance. This might necessitate a combination of political agreement among all parties within Holyrood (the Scottish Parliament), approval from Her Majesty's Government in London to amend the Scotland Act itself through parliamentary procedures and potential public consultations or referenda if proposed changes pertained directly with matters deemed as national importance by some sections of UK society.
