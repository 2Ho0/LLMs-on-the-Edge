0;where did mexico win its independence from spain; On September 27 , 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City , and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was henceforth to be called . The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes . Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown . Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide 's followers . ;" Mexico won its independence from Spain on September 27, 1821. The independence movement began in 1810 when Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla led the famous ""Grito de Dolores"" (Cry of Dolores) in the town of Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato. This sparked a series of uprisings across Mexico against Spanish rule. After several years of fighting and numerous leaders, among them José María Morelos y Pavón and Agustín de Iturbide, Mexico was finally able to negotiate its independence with Spain in 1821. The agreement, known as the Plan de Iguala, established a federal republic based on the principles of religion, unity, and independence.";100;8;99;31.13524556159973;8.95625;10.25

6;what type of reaction leads to the production of polymers; The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry . Nylons must specifically include an straight chain ( aliphatic ) monomer . The amide link is produced from an amine group ( alternatively known as an amino group ) , and a carboxylic acid group . The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine , and gives rise to water , the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction . ;" The type of reaction that leads to the production of polymers is Polymerization. Polymerization is a process where simple molecules called monomers combine together in a repeating fashion, forming long chains or three-dimensional networks of large molecules (polymers). This process can occur through two main types:

1. Addition polymerization: In this type of polymerization, monomers with carbon-carbon unsaturation (usually a carbon-carbon double bond) react to form covalent bonds between the repeating units. The polymer chain grows continuously as more monomer units are added to the growing chain. Examples include polyethylene and polystyrene.

2. Condensation polymerization: In this type, two functional groups in each monomer react with one another, releasing a small molecule (usually a water molecule) as a byproduct. The polymer chain grows step-by-step, with each addition of a new repeating unit resulting from the reaction between a growing chain and a new monomer unit. Examples include nylon, cellulose, and proteins.

Both types of polymerization can be carried out in different ways (e.g., bulk, solution, emulsion, suspension, and precipitation polymerizations), depending on the specific requirements of the process and the desired properties of the resulting polymer.";186;10;80;39.67103433609009;14.88561764705882;96.82352941176471
7;when did the one game wild card start; From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series . However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult . The new system was instituted in 1994 ( but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs ) when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league . In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs . In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed . This was the team with the most wins amongst non-division winners . The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league . ;" The one-game Wild Card playoff in Major League Baseball (MLB) started with the 1994 postseason, although it was originally intended to begin in the 1993 postseason. The change came due to a players' strike that shortened the 1994 season and affected the playoffs format.

Prior to 1994, teams with the best records in each league (American League and National League) were directly seeded for the Division Series without any Wild Card game. The introduction of the one-game Wild Card playoff expanded the playoffs by adding a single game between two wild card teams from both leagues.

The first ever one-game Wild Card playoff took place on October 3, 1994, between the American League's Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park in Boston. The Indians won the game 10–5 and advanced to face the New York Yankees in the Division Series. However, due to the players' strike, the rest of the postseason was ultimately cancelled that year.

The first one-game Wild Card playoff to be played after the resolution of the players' strike took place on October 1, 2012, between the National League's St. Louis Cardinals and the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field in Atlanta. The Cardinals won the game 6–3 and advanced to face the Washington Nationals in the Division Series.";214;8;181;41.70132088661194;14.876527777777774;95.25

13;how many pages are in the harry potter series; Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93⁄4 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . ;" The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling consists of seven books:

1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (309 pages)
2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (223 pages)

14;where is the lava stored in a volcano;" A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth . The molten rock , or magma , in such a chamber is under great pressure , and , given enough time , that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it , creating a way for the magma to move upward . If it finds its way to the surface , then the result will be a volcanic eruption ; consequently , many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers . These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth , and therefore most of those known are close to the surface , commonly between 1 km and 10 km down . ";" Lava, which is molten rock produced by a volcano, is not actually ""stored"" anywhere inside a volcano. Instead, it resides within the mantle beneath the Earth's crust, at depths of 50 to 200 kilometers (31-124 miles). When magma rises towards the surface due to pressure or other factors, it becomes lava upon reaching the Earth's surface and erupting from the volcano. The storage chambers for magma in a volcano are called magma chambers or reservoirs, which are usually located just below the active part of the volcano where there is enough space to accommodate rising magma without causing immediate eruptions.";100;8;119;21.548770904541016;14.866222222222218;95.72222222222223

16;who led the american occupation of puerto rico during the spanish-american war; Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , ratified on December 10 , 1898 , Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States . Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence . The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island , acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs . Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain . By October 18 , the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain . Those who belonged to the Spanish military who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed `` Porto Rico Regiment '' . Some took the offer , such as Teófilo Marxuach , a former Lieutenant in the Spanish Army who joined the regiment , and others , such as Capt . Angel Rivero Méndez , declined the offer and retired from the military . ;" The American occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War was not exactly a ""military campaign"" led by one person, but rather an outcome of the peace treaty that ended the war. The U.S. military forces, under the overall command of General Nelson A. Miles, captured Puerto Rico from Spain in July 1898 during the brief conflict. However, it was not until December 10, 1898, with the signing of the Treaty of Paris, that Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. Afterward, the U.S. appointed a civilian governor, Charles Herbert Allen, who oversaw the administration of the island from August 1899 until April 1900.";105;12;204;21.206902980804443;14.87722222222222;96.72222222222223

19;when did they stop using knob and tube wiring in homes; Knob - and - tube wiring ( sometimes abbreviated K&T ) is an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings , in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s . It consisted of single - insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities , passing through joist and stud drill - holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes , and supported along their length on nailed - down porcelain knob insulators . Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch , or were pulled into a wall , they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom . The first insulation was asphalt - saturated cotton cloth , then rubber became common . Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength , then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape ( asphalt saturated cloth ) , or made inside metal junction boxes . ; Knob and tube (K&T) wiring, a method of electrical wiring that uses individual insulated copper wires encased in flexible fabric tubing, with porcelain or vinyl knobs to provide mechanical support, was primarily used from the late 1800s to the mid-1950s. In North America, the National Electrical Code (NEC) started phasing out K&T wiring by the mid-1960s, and it became increasingly uncommon after that period. However, due to its longevity, some homes still have K&T wiring installed, especially in older buildings. It is essential to be aware of this type of wiring when purchasing or renovating an old home, as it may pose safety risks if not updated properly.;108;11;160;23.109322786331177;14.881473684210523;94.78947368421052
20;when did they stop hanging in the us; Hanging has been practiced legally in the United States of America from the nation 's birth , up to 1972 when the United States Supreme Court found capital punishment to be in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution . Four years later , the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling , and in 1976 , capital punishment was again legalized in the United States . Hanging has returned to the states of Washington and New Hampshire . ;" It seems there might be some confusion in your question. The phrase ""they"" is not specific enough to provide a clear answer. If you're asking about capital punishment (death penalty), it's important to note that the death penalty is still legal in some states of the United States, although its application varies greatly and has been subject to much debate. However, I recommend consulting a more authoritative source for the most accurate information on this topic. If you meant something else by ""they,"" please provide more context so I can give a more accurate response.";95;8;81;15.88184142112732;14.880461538461534;95.76923076923077
21;the day the earth stood still famous phrase; `` Klaatu barada nikto '' is a phrase that originated in the 1951 science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still . The humanoid alien protagonist of the film , Klaatu ( Michael Rennie ) , instructs Helen Benson ( Patricia Neal ) that if any harm befalls him , she must say the phrase to the robot Gort ( Lockard Martin ) . In response Gort relents from destroying the Earth and resurrects Klaatu from death . ;" The famous phrase from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is ""Klaatu barada nikto,"" which was used to signal that the humanoid alien character Klaatu meant peace. This phrase was crucial in the film, as it saved Klaatu's life when he was being threatened by military forces.";47;8;79;9.789788961410522;14.879285714285713;92.85714285714286
22;what is the purpose of constructing a calibration curve;" In analytical chemistry , a calibration curve , also known as a standard curve , is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration . A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration ; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown , giving an internal standard . ";" A calibration curve is used to relate an instrument's response (such as signal intensity or output) to the concentration, amount, or property being measured. It serves several purposes:

1. To establish the relationship between the instrumental measurement and the true value of the quantity being measured. This allows for the conversion of raw data from the instrument into meaningful units that can be easily understood and interpreted.

2. To determine the linearity range of an instrument, which is the range of concentrations or amounts where the instrument's response is proportional to the actual value. This helps in choosing the appropriate measuring range for accurate results.

3. To compensate for instrumental drift, systematic errors, and other sources of bias by adjusting the instrument based on the calibration curve. This ensures that the measured values are as close as possible to the true values.

4. To quantify the precision and accuracy of the measurement method or instrument used. By repeating measurements under controlled conditions and analyzing the resulting data, the error associated with the measurement can be determined and potential sources of error can be identified and addressed.

5. To validate the suitability of the analytical method for a given application by demonstrating that it meets the necessary accuracy, precision, and linearity requirements. This helps in ensuring reliable and consistent results when applying the method to real-world samples.";226;9;73;37.928608894348145;14.869484848484849;95.96969696969697

24;where is the silk road located on a map; The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea . The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia and Europe . The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road ( s ) . ;" The Silk Road was not a single, continuous route but a network of trade routes that connected the East (China) with the West (Europe). On a map, it spanned across several countries in Asia and Europe. Here's an overview:

1. China - Started in Chang'an (currently Xi'an) or Luoyang.
2. Through Gansu province and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, passing through cities like Dunhuang.
3. Continued through the Taklamakan Desert and reached Central Asia, passing through present-day Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan.
4. Crossed into Persia (Iran), passing through cities like Merv, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Herat.
5. Continued through Afghanistan, reaching Pakistan and India.

26;what's the difference between tweedle dee and tweedle dum; Tweedledum and Tweedledee are fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking - Glass , and What Alice Found There . Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom . The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800 . The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways , generally in a derogatory context . ;" Tweedledee and Tweedledum are fictional characters from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" a sequel to his more famous work, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" Despite sharing many similarities due to being portrayed as identical twins, there are some subtle differences between Tweedledee and Tweedledum:

1. Personalities: Although both characters often speak at the same time, Tweedledee is generally described as more emotional and impulsive, while Tweedledum is calmer and more rational.

2. Physical Attributes: There are slight differences in their physical appearances, although these distinctions are often overlooked due to their identical clothing and overall similarities. In Carroll's original illustrations by John Tenniel, it can be seen that Tweedledee has a more rounded face and larger eyes compared to Tweedledum, who appears broader and stockier.

3. Dialogue: Tweedledee is usually the one who initiates the dialogue between the two, whereas Tweedledum responds or contributes less frequently. This is evident in their interactions with Alice during her encounter with them, such as when they discuss whether it's ""winter here"" or ""not.""

4. Symbolism: Some interpretations suggest that Tweedledee and Tweedledum represent two sides of the same coin or two aspects of a single character. This symbolizes the idea of unity and duality, as they are indistinguishable in many ways yet possess their unique traits.";212;9;85;46.75871992111206;14.871536585365849;95.07317073170732
27;what do the lyrics mean to lady marmalade; Labelle 's version of `` Lady Marmalade '' was produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham . It was released in November 1974 from Nightbirds , their first album after signing with Epic Records . Patti LaBelle sang lead vocals on `` Lady Marmalade '' with backing vocals being contributed by bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash . The song is best known for the French lyric `` Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? '' ( English : `` Would you like to sleep with me tonight ? '' ) in the refrain . `` Lady Marmalade '' is a song about a prostitute , although Patti LaBelle , the lead female vocal of the band , was completely oblivious to its overall message , saying : `` I did n't know what it was about . I do n't know French and nobody , I swear this is God 's truth , nobody at all told me what I 'd just sung a song about . '' ;" ""Lady Marmalade"" is a song by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink from the Moulin Rouge! soundtrack. The lyrics are primarily about Satine, the main female character in the movie, and her relationship with the Duke of Monroth, played by Ewan McGregor.

Here is a breakdown of some key lyrics:

- ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?"" which translates to ""Do you want to sleep with me tonight?"" is a French phrase that sets the scene for the rest of the song.

- ""Mimi, she was a girl in a port city"" refers to Satine, who grew up in a seaport city (Harmony Island).

- ""Workin' like a prostitute on the streets of Old New Orleans"" suggests that Satine worked as an entertainer at the Moulin Rouge. The phrase is repeated throughout the song and has become iconic.

- ""Treat her mean, keep her fiendish, gotta be more than just your average lady"" indicates that the Duke keeps Satine in a precarious position, maintaining their relationship through manipulation and control.

- ""I'm not that girl, I'm the Lady Marmalade"" is Satine asserting her independence and self-worth, ultimately choosing to leave the Duke for a better life with Christian (played by Jared Leto).

Overall, the song represents the struggle between love, manipulation, and power in the story of Moulin Rouge.";220;8;171;46.24624991416931;14.864825;92.875

It can be issued under the following circumstances:

1. The recipient of the writ holds a public office and has a clear legal duty to perform an act.
2. The duty is discretionary in nature (not ministerial), but it must not be one that inherently involves a substantial amount of policy-making or decision-making about general matters of public interest.
3. The petitioner seeking the writ has suffered, or is likely to suffer, a direct legal harm due to the official's failure to perform their duty.
4. There are no other adequate remedies available for the petitioner.
5. The law grants the right to issue such a writ in the specific circumstances of the case.

It's important to note that Writs of Mandamus are typically issued by appellate courts, not trial courts, and they are used sparingly because they can interfere with the discretion of public officials.";176;8;148;31.46266198158264;14.87774074074074;94.4074074074074
32;what is an honorable discharge from the marines; To receive an honorable discharge , a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for his or her service . Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct , and who complete their tours of duty , normally receive honorable discharges . However , one need not complete a term of service to receive an honorable discharge , provided the reason for involuntary discharge is not due to misconduct . For instance , service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable , regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty , provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards . Similarly , service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force ( RIF ) typically receive an honorable discharge , assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards . ;" An Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps is a type of military discharge that is given to service members who have completed their enlistment period, or who are separated due to a reduction in the size of the Marine Corps, and have an otherwise unblemished record. This means they have no negative marks on their service record and have met all the obligations of their enlistment contract.

An Honorable Discharge is the highest level of discharge that can be awarded, signifying that the Marine has served with honor, courage, and commitment to the principles and values of the Corps. It is considered a positive mark on one's record and generally does not have any negative impact on future employment or educational opportunities.

In addition to an Honorable Discharge, there are other types of discharges from the Marine Corps, including General Under Honorable Conditions (GUD) and Bad Conduct Discharge, which indicate a less than honorable service record due to misconduct, disciplinary problems, or failure to meet service obligations.";168;8;161;30.15728735923767;14.869230769230768;96.65384615384616
33;when did the first us state legalize weed; The legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state - level prohibition in the early 20th century , with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937 .

In 1996 , California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis , sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016 . In 2012 , Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for recreational use . ; The first U.S. state to legalize marijuana for recreational use was Colorado, on January 1, 2014. Washington State followed closely behind, also legalizing it on the same day. These two states had already legalized marijuana for medical purposes prior to this, in 2009 and 2011 respectively.

34;where did the settlers of new hampshire come from;" Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the early 17th century , and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century . Prior to English colonization of the area , it was inhabited by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes . The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower . It set precedents but never grew large . A large - scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies . Friction with the natives erupted in the high - casualty King Philip 's War in the 1670s . Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced ; dissenters were exiled . The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter . Most people were farmers . Businessmen established wide - ranging trade links , sending ships to the West Indies and Europe , and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts . These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 . ";" The settlers who came to New Hampshire were primarily English Puritans and other European groups, such as French Huguenots, Scot-Irish, and German Palatines. The first recorded English settlement in what is now New Hampshire was at Strype's Port (later known as Dover) in 1623 by John Mason, a merchant from Oldham, Lancashire, England.

The earliest Puritan settlers arrived in the late 1620s and early 1630s, fleeing religious persecution in Massachusetts Bay Colony. They established settlements such as Exeter (1638), Hampton (1638), Portsmouth (1639), and Rye (1641). These settlers were followed by waves of English immigrants throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, including families from Devon, Dorset, Somerset, Essex, Suffolk, and other counties in England.

Other European groups also settled in New Hampshire during this period. The French Huguenots established a settlement at Casco Bay (present-day Portland, Maine) in 1658 before being forced out by the English in 1664. Scot-Irish immigrants arrived in large numbers after the end of the American Revolution, and German Palatines settled in the Connecticut River Valley during the same period.

The influx of settlers from England and other European countries helped shape New Hampshire's cultural, economic, and political landscape and laid the foundation for the diverse and vibrant state it is today.";206;9;208;45.78538203239441;14.87705;95.975

Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986 , but the deal did not include the television rights to Gone with the Wind , which were still held by CBS . A deal was struck in which the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS 's broadcast rights to The Wizard of Oz were extended . It was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System : Turner Network Television ( 1988 ) and Turner Classic Movies ( 1994 ) . It debuted on videocassette in March 1985 , where it placed second in the sales charts , and has since been released on DVD and Blu - ray Disc formats . ;" The exact air date for ""Gone With the Wind"" can vary depending on the broadcasting network and region.

36;the three pillars of the westphalian constitution of world politics are; Westphalian sovereignty , or state sovereignty , is the principle of international law that each nation - state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory . External powers should not interfere in another country 's domestic affairs . Each state , no matter how large or small , has equal rights to sovereignty . The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states . The United Nations Charter states that `` nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . '' ;"1. Recognition of Sovereign Equality: This principle states that all sovereign states, regardless of their size, power, or internal structure, are considered equal in the international community.

2. Non-Intervention: This principle asserts that one state should not interfere in the domestic affairs of another state unless expressly permitted by international law or the consent of the affected state has been granted.

3. Peaceful Settlement of Disputes: This principle encourages states to resolve their disagreements and conflicts through peaceful means, rather than resorting to force or war. It promotes diplomacy, negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and other forms of dispute resolution to maintain international peace and stability.

These principles are often associated with the Peace of Westphalia, a series of treaties signed in 1648 that ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe. The Westphalian system is considered the foundation of modern international relations, where states act as the primary actors in global politics.";150;11;87;29.74832034111023;14.872359999999999;94.88
37;what type of genetic mutation is huntington's disease;" HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , although up to 10 % of cases are due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results . "; Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene on chromosome 4. This genetic mutation is called a trinucleotide repeat expansion or triplet repeat expansion. Normally, this region has between 6-35 repeats, but in HD patients, there are more than 40 repeats. The expanded region of the IT15 gene leads to the production of an abnormal huntingtin protein that accumulates in neurons and causes their degeneration, leading to the symptoms of Huntington's disease.;80;8;191;18.234268188476562;14.87433333333333;94.73333333333333
