5;Along with geothermal and nuclear, what is a notable non-combustion heat source?;solar power;" Solar energy is another notable non-combustion heat source. Solar power harnesses the energy from the sun through various technologies like solar panels (photovoltaic), concentrated solar power systems, and solar water heating. These technologies convert sunlight directly into electricity or thermal energy that can be used for heating purposes.

Unlike fossil fuels or geothermal resources, solar energy is abundant, renewable, and clean, making it a crucial component in the transition towards sustainable energy production.";73;12;2;12.708624362945557;12.554636363636364;83.0909090909091
6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;" The Prime Number Theorem, one of the most celebrated results in number theory, describes the distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers. It states that the probability that a randomly selected integer n is prime is inversely proportional to its logarithm, and the constant in the proportion can be explicitly stated. Specifically, if P(x) denotes the prime counting function (the number of primes less than or equal to x), then the Prime Number Theorem asserts that:

    lim (x->infinity) [P(x) * log(x)] = x

This theorem provides important insights into the distribution and behavior of prime numbers, connecting arithmetic functions like the summatory function Σ(f(n)) and their analytic counterparts in complex analysis. The Prime Number Theorem was first proposed by Gauss and later independently proved by Hadamard and de la Vallée Poussin in the late 19th century.";137;11;5;23.065972805023193;13.07995;94.05

13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France; The Huguenots, who were French Protestants in the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern Period, were primarily concentrated in several regions of France. One of the most significant areas was along the south-eastern coast, particularly in cities like Nîmes, Montpellier, Orange, and Toulon. Other important centers included Rouen and Dieppe in Normandy, La Rochelle in Poitou-Charentes, and parts of Languedoc-Roussillon, Guyenne, and Burgundy. These regions were traditionally Catholic strongholds where the Reformation gained significant support due to factors like economic prosperity, urbanization, and intellectual openness. The Huguenots also had a significant presence in Paris, which made their religious activities more visible and sometimes led to conflict with the Catholic authorities.;110;7;7;19.981913566589355;12.803166666666664;89.11111111111111
14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;" Ctenophora, also known as Comb jellies or Sea walnuts, are a phylum of aquatic invertebrates. They are characterized by their unique eight rows of cilia that run longitudinally along their bodies and resemble comb teeth, which is where the name ""Ctenophora"" comes from (from Greek: κτεῖνος, kteînos, ""comb"", and φέρω, phérō, ""to bear"").

Unlike most other ciliated animals, their cilia do not function in locomotion, but rather to maintain a current of water through their bodies for feeding. They are translucent and come in various colors due to the presence of guanine crystals within their cells. The comb jelly is an interesting creature with a simple body structure consisting of a bell-shaped outer casing, from which eight rows of cilia protrude, surrounding a central stalk or bulb that contains the mouth, gonads, and digestive organs.

Compared to many other marine creatures, there are only about 150 described species of Ctenophora found in the world's oceans. They can be found in both tropical and cold waters, from the shallow coastal regions to the depths of the ocean floor. Despite their delicate appearance, they are capable predators, feeding on small zooplankton, such as krill and copepods.";194;4;8;35.66501569747925;12.950562500000002;93.84375
15;Along with non-governmental and nonstate schools, what is another name for private schools?;indipendent; Another common term for private schools is independent schools.

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;" Imperialism is usually administered through various means, which often include:

1. Colonial Administration: The establishment of a system of governance that allows the colonizing power to control and exploit the resources of the colony while maintaining order. This could involve the appointment of governing bodies, such as a governor-general or other officials who report back to the home country.

2. Indirect Rule: In this method, local rulers are maintained but are controlled by the imperial power through various means like appointing advisors, requiring them to follow certain policies, and maintaining military forces in case of rebellion.

3. Assimilation: This policy aims to integrate the subject population into the culture, economy, and political system of the imperial power. It often involves abolishing local customs, languages, and laws, and promoting those of the imperial power.

4. Informal Imperialism: This is a more subtle form of control that doesn't involve direct territorial acquisition or governance. Instead, it involves economic, political, and cultural influence over another country, often through trade agreements, foreign aid, or cultural exchanges.

5. Neo-Imperialism: This refers to the contemporary form of imperialism, characterized by economic domination rather than territorial control. It often involves transnational corporations exploiting resources or labor in developing countries, with little regard for local laws or welfare.

6. Cultural Imperialism: This is a process where one culture imposes its beliefs, customs, and practices on another, often through the spread of media, technology, and ideology. This can lead to the marginalization or loss of local cultures and traditions.";250;7;8;40.093714237213135;12.957472222222224;93.52777777777777
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;" Improvements and expansions upon Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion were made by various scientists throughout history, but the timeline is quite extensive. Here are some key milestones:

1. 1687: Publication of Newton's ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia"" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) which introduced his three laws of motion.

2. 1744-1745: Euler's work on the dynamics of rigid bodies, building upon and extending Newtonian mechanics.

3. Late 18th century to early 19th century: The development of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics by Joseph-Louis Lagrange and William Rowan Hamilton, respectively, which provided alternative formulations of classical mechanics, making it easier to solve certain problems and more amenable to generalization.

4. Mid 19th century: James Clerk Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, demonstrating that electric and magnetic forces could be described by a set of four equations, now known as Maxwell's equations. This work not only furthered our understanding of electromagnetism but also connected it with optics.

5. Late 19th century: Hendrik Antoon Lorentz developed the Lorentz force law, which describes the interaction between a charged particle and an electromagnetic field.

6. Early 20th century: Albert Einstein published his Special Theory of Relativity (1905) and General Theory of Relativity (1915). The special theory introduced the concept of space-time and showed that the laws of physics, including Newton's laws, are approximations valid only at low velocities. The general theory replaced Newton's law of universal gravitation with a geometrical description of gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

7. Mid 20th century: Paul Dirac's work on quantum mechanics, specifically his prediction of antimatter in 1931, demonstrated that even classical mechanics had to be modified when dealing with very small scales (the realm of quantum physics).

These developments show that improvements and expansions upon Newton's laws continued well beyond his lifetime and remain an active area of research today.";303;14;4;56.876293659210205;12.900627450980387;93.0
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"1. Political System: Islamism advocates for the establishment or re-establishment of an Islamic state, often referred to as a caliphate or an Ummah (community of believers). The political system in such a state is based on Sharia law.

2. Legal System: Islamism aims to replace secular legal systems with one based on the principles and interpretations of Sharia law. This can include various aspects of criminal law, family law, property law, and civil law.

3. Social Structure: Islamism seeks to integrate Islamic values into social norms and behaviors. This could involve advocating for the segregation of men and women in public spaces, promoting the adoption of traditional Islamic dress codes, and discouraging practices that are considered haram (forbidden) according to Islamic teachings.

4. Education System: Islamism encourages an education system that promotes Islamic values and teaches Sharia law. This can include the use of Islamic texts as a primary source of knowledge, and the incorporation of religious studies into the curriculum.

5. Economic System: While there is no universally accepted model for an Islamic economy, Islamism advocates for economic practices that align with Islamic principles, such as prohibiting interest (riba), promoting fair trade, and encouraging charitable giving (zakat).

6. Cultural Expression: Islamism seeks to integrate Islamic values into cultural expressions, including music, art, literature, and media. This can involve censorship of material deemed contrary to Islamic teachings, and the promotion of Islamic themes in cultural productions.

7. Foreign Policy: Islamism often influences a country's foreign policy, with a focus on promoting Islamic principles globally and supporting Muslim-majority countries or causes. This can include providing aid to Muslim communities, supporting jihad (holy war), and advocating for the protection of Islamic sacred sites.

8. Personal Conduct: Islamism encourages individuals to integrate Islamic values into their daily lives, including prayer, fasting during Ramadan, charity, honesty, and respect for others.";306;11;4;51.15647554397583;12.875391304347822;92.43478260869566
20;When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?;Following a referendum in 1997;" I'm sorry for any confusion, but it's important to clarify that there is no current parliament of Scotland as Scotland is now a devolved nation within the United Kingdom. The Scottish Parliament in its modern form (devolved parliament) was established on July 1, 1999, following the referendum held on September 11, 1997, which approved the establishment of this parliament. Before that, the Parliament of Scotland or the ""Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland"" had its last meeting in 1707, when it merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain (later known as the Parliament of the United Kingdom).";103;8;5;16.898212671279907;13.097866666666667;89.73333333333333

22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;" To provide an answer, I would need specific data on the number of ""10 million dollar millionaires"" (individuals with a net worth of exactly $10 million) and their average wealth. However, for context, it's important to note that the term ""millionaire"" is often used to refer to individuals with at least $1 million in assets, but can also be used more broadly to encompass higher-net-worth individuals.

As of 2008, there were approximately 466,593 high net worth individuals (HNWI) worldwide with a minimum net worth of $10 million, according to the Knight Frank Wealth Report. The average wealth of this group was estimated at around $18.7 million in 2008. So, calculating for the number of ""10 million dollar millionaires"" would be difficult without specific data.

This means that if we were to make an approximation based on the Knight Frank Wealth Report's average wealth data, the combined wealth of all HNWIs (including those with net worth above $10 million) in 2008 would have been around $8.7 trillion.";166;14;3;29.4234402179718;12.943346153846152;92.23076923076923
23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973;" The 1973 oil crisis, also known as the ""October War"" embargo or the ""Energy Crisis of 1973-1974,"" began on October 16, 1973. This international energy supply disruption was precipitated by the decision of members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) to stop supplying oil to countries that supported Israel during the Yom Kippur War. The crisis lasted until March 1974, leading to a significant increase in oil prices and an economic slowdown around the world.";78;7;2;15.34531545639038;13.03076923076923;87.0
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries; The Normans, also known as the Northmen or Vikings, first arrived in what is now Normandy (a region in France) around the late 9th century. They began to settle and establish themselves as a powerful force in the region during the 10th century under their first notable leader, Rollon, who was given control of the area by King Charles the Simple of France in 911 as part of a treaty to stop Viking raids on the French coast. The Duchy of Normandy was formally established in 933 when Hugh the Great was granted the territory by King Louis IV. So, technically speaking, the Normans have been in Normandy for over 1,000 years.;112;6;4;17.81754183769226;12.703374999999998;87.625
25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;" The term you're looking for is ""Civil Disobedience."" Civil disobedience refers to the active, but nonviolent, resistance to laws, regulations, or actions of a government or other authority considered oppressive, unjust, or undemocratic. It is a method of protest that seeks to draw attention to and challenge these perceived injustices by refusing to comply with them. Notable examples include the American Civil Rights Movement led by Martin Luther King Jr., the Indian independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, and the Suffragette movement in Britain. It's important to note that while civil disobedience is a means of protest, it should not be confused with lawlessness or anarchy, as it operates within the bounds of nonviolent resistance.";115;15;2;19.254618883132935;12.786294117647058;88.76470588235294
26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;" The main sources of primary law, also known as the primary legal sources, vary slightly depending on the legal system but generally include:

1. Constitutions: The supreme legal document in a country that sets out its fundamental laws and establishes the structure, procedures, powers, and duties of the government. In some countries, like the United States, it is the Constitution that provides the foundation for all other laws.

2. Statutes (Acts or Legislation): These are written laws enacted by a legislative body, such as Congress in the U.S., Parliament in the UK, or the Bundestag in Germany. They often deal with specific matters and have general applicability across the jurisdiction.

3. Regulations (Delegated or Secondary Legislation): These are rules issued by governmental agencies or departments to implement and interpret statutes. The goal is to provide greater detail, clarify ambiguities in laws, or set specific requirements for their enforcement.

4. Case Law (Precedent or Jurisprudence): This source of primary law consists of decisions made by courts in individual cases that serve as a guide for future decisions on similar issues. The principles established through case law help to ensure consistency and predictability in the application of the law.

5. Customary Law: In some legal systems, long-standing customs and traditions can be recognized as law, especially when they have been accepted and followed for so long that they are considered binding. This is particularly important in international law and indigenous communities.

6. International Treaties and Conventions: These are agreements between nations on specific issues, such as human rights or trade, which are intended to be binding and enforceable under international law. When ratified by a country, they become part of its internal legal system.";282;8;5;43.83410668373108;12.921974358974357;88.74358974358974
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia; The Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in the region of present-day Mongolia. It began as a bubonic plague among rats and their fleas that lived in the dense populations of black rats associated with human habitation along the Silk Road trade routes in the mid-14th century (around 1346–1353 AD). The exact location within Mongolia is not definitively known, but theories suggest it could have been near the city of Peking or the steppes north of the Yellow River. From Asia, the plague spread rapidly westward across Eurasia, reaching Europe by 1347 and eventually affecting much of the continent, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Black Death killed an estimated 75-200 million people and altered the course of human history.;135;6;6;22.534443378448486;12.822999999999997;89.75
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching; Paul Baran developed the concept of packet switching, which is a fundamental technology for data communication in computer networks. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he designed and proposed the idea of message switching systems that broke down messages into small packets, stored them in memory, and reassembled them at their destination. Baran's work was instrumental to the development of modern computer networks such as the Internet.;68;5;10;11.08694863319397;12.432599999999999;87.1
29;When was the French and Indian War?;1754?1763; The French and Indian War, known as the Seven Years' War in Europe, took place from 1756 to 1763. This conflict was part of a larger global struggle for colonial supremacy between Great Britain and France. It marked a significant turning point in North American history and set the stage for the American Revolution. The war is named after the alliance between the French and various Native American tribes against British forces, led primarily by the colonists in America.;79;7;1;11.761153936386108;12.7281;87.1
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens; The agents that the immune system detects are primarily pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Additionally, the immune system also recognizes and responds to foreign substances like toxins or transplanted organs. In terms of specific molecules, these can be broadly categorized into antigens, which are any molecule that triggers an immune response. This includes proteins on the surface of pathogens, toxins, and altered self-molecules in cases like cancer or autoimmune diseases.;73;10;1;13.957608222961426;12.749166666666667;87.25
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory; The branch of theoretical computer science that deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and the nature of their relationships is called Computational Complexity Theory. This theory aims to understand the inherent difficulties in solving computational problems, which helps guide the development of efficient algorithms and data structures. It introduces important classes like P (Polynomial time), NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time), NP-complete, NP-hard, and co-NP problems to categorize the complexity of various computational tasks.;74;18;3;13.406548976898193;12.539249999999997;89.0

33;What percentile of gross domestic product is construction comprised of?;six to nine percent;" The percentage of a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that is attributable to the construction industry can vary significantly across different countries and over time due to various factors such as economic development, infrastructure needs, government policies, and urbanization rates.

As an assistant, I don't have real-time data or the ability to browse databases, but according to recent World Bank data for the year 2019:

* In the United States, construction accounted for approximately 6% of GDP.
* In China, construction contributed around 8.7%.
* In India, construction represented about 7.5%.

These figures can help give you a general idea of the range of contributions made by the construction industry to a country's overall economic output. However, it's essential to check more up-to-date and specific data for each case, as these percentages may have changed since 2019.";137;10;4;23.34558129310608;13.796523809523805;93.28571428571429

35;Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?;Antigone;" The play by Sophocles that is often associated with civil disobedience, albeit not directly depicting it as the term is used today, is ""Antigone."" In this play, Antigone defies Creon's unjust law by burying her brother Polynices, who was left unburied because he fought against Thebes. This act of defiance is seen as a form of civil disobedience, as Antigone chooses to follow her conscience and moral values rather than the law of the state, which she deems unfair and inhumane. This theme has been connected to modern concepts of civil disobedience, particularly in situations where individuals peacefully resist unjust laws or systems.";103;10;1;17.95100498199463;12.751624999999997;90.0

Some notable University of Chicago scholars include:

1. Milton Friedman (Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 1976): He was a key proponent of monetarism, arguing that controlling the money supply is essential for maintaining economic stability. He also advocated for free-market principles and minimal government intervention in the economy.

2. George Stigler (Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 1982): Known as a founder of the Chicago School of economics, he made significant contributions to microeconomics, public choice theory, and the study of industrial organization.

3. Gary Becker (Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 1992): A pioneer in the field of human capital and labor economics, he applied economic analysis to various social issues, including crime, discrimination, and family structure.

4. Theodore Schultz (Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 1979) and Thomas Schelling (Nobel Laureate in Economic Sciences 2005): Both made important contributions to the development of behavioral economics, focusing on how individuals make decisions under uncertainty and the effects of these decisions on economic outcomes.

In addition to their impact on modern economics, University of Chicago scholars have also influenced other disciplines, such as political science, sociology, and philosophy, through interdisciplinary research and collaboration.";239;11;3;42.32785630226135;12.860421052631578;94.15789473684211
37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;" The term ""imperialism"" originates from the Latin word ""imperium,"" which means authority, power, or rule. It was used during the Roman Republic and later as the foundation for the political structure of the Roman Empire. In modern usage, imperialism refers to a policy in which a stronger country extends its rule by colonizing, controlling, and exploiting weaker countries for economic gain, resources, influence, or strategic military advantage.";67;10;1;10.916006088256836;12.968;84.33333333333333
38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly established by two United Nations organizations, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), in 1988. This joint committee aims to provide policymakers with objective scientific information about climate change, its implications, and potential future risks and responses. The IPCC assesses the science related to climate change, identifies uncertainties, and promotes open dialogue between governments and experts on actions to address these challenges.;76;6;12;13.643521070480347;12.614333333333333;89.16666666666667
39;Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?;Diatomic oxygen; The gas that makes up approximately 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere is Oxygen (O2). It plays a crucial role in supporting life on our planet, as it is used by most organisms for respiration. The remaining percentage is mainly composed of Nitrogen (N2), which constitutes about 78% of the atmosphere. The rest is made up of trace gases like Argon (Ar), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and others.;66;9;2;12.420903444290161;12.517000000000001;88.18181818181819
40;What is the Yuan dynasty's official name?;the Great Yuan; The Yuan Dynasty, which ruled China from 1271 to 1368, was officially known as the Great Yuan (大元). It was established by Genghis Khan and his successors after they conquered much of Asia and united several nomadic tribes. The Mongol Empire at its height stretched from China in the east to Europe in the west. The Yuan Dynasty is also known for the Pax Mongolica, a period of relative peace and stability across much of Eurasia due to the rule of the Mongols.;83;7;3;14.15650987625122;12.926250000000001;86.0
41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens;" The cells that are recognized and targeted by the immune system are called antigens. However, you asked for ""the agents"" detected, not ""the agents"" targeted. Antigens, in this context, are substances on a cell or virus that trigger an immune response. But if you meant to ask about the immune cells themselves, they are often referred to as leukocytes (white blood cells), although there are several types such as T-cells, B-cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and more.";75;10;1;13.364071607589722;13.37641666666667;89.33333333333333
42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;" European Union (EU) law, also known as Union law or Community law, refers to the body of laws that bind member states of the European Union. These laws are derived from several sources and include:

1. Treaties: The founding treaties of the EU, such as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on European Union (TEU), establish the structure and objectives of the EU.
2. Regulations: These are binding legislative acts that are directly applicable in all member states without needing to be implemented by national legislation.
3. Directives: Directives are legal acts that require member states to achieve a particular goal within a specified timeframe, but they leave it up to each country to choose the means of implementation.
4. Decisions: These are legally binding for the addressee(s) and have immediate effect in those countries or entities concerned.
5. Case law: The interpretations and judgments made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
6. Charter of Fundamental Rights: This is a key document that sets out the fundamental rights and freedoms to which everyone in the EU is entitled, such as human dignity, freedom, equality, and solidarity.
7. Other acts: These may include recommendations, opinions, and communications issued by various EU institutions like the European Commission and the Council of the European Union.

These laws are designed to promote harmonious relations among member states, protect their citizens' rights, and establish a single market for goods and services across the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) plays a crucial role in interpreting and enforcing EU law.";269;5;26;41.65471363067627;13.033567567567566;92.8108108108108
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;" In ancient Greece, the philosophers primarily studied and discussed what we now know as mechanics using the concept of ""mechanical philosophy"" or ""physics."" This was a part of natural philosophy, which encompassed the study of all aspects of nature. They were particularly interested in understanding motion and the principles governing simple machines such as levers, pulleys, wedges, screws, and wheels and axles – what we now call machines.

The prominent philosophers who contributed to this field include Aristotle, Archimedes, Hero of Alexandria, and others from the Hellenistic period. They formulated principles that would later become fundamental in classical mechanics such as the laws of motion.

Aristotle, for example, discussed simple machines in his book ""Mechanical Problems,"" where he explained various mechanical devices and their uses. Archimedes made significant contributions to the study of levers with his famous principle stating that a lever's effectiveness is dependent on the ratio between its lengths and the weights at each end. Hero of Alexandria, meanwhile, developed several mechanical devices, including the first steam engine, known as the Aeolipile.

So, in short, philosophers in antiquity used ""mechanical philosophy"" or ""physics"" to study simple machines.";189;11;4;31.48053765296936;12.906750000000004;91.78571428571429
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"1. Autonomy and Flexibility: Private schools have more autonomy in terms of governance, curriculum, and operational decisions compared to public schools. They can make decisions without being bound by the same regulations that public schools must follow. This allows for a more customized approach to education.

2. Tuition Fees: Private schools can charge tuition fees, which helps them fund their programs and infrastructure. Public schools are funded primarily by taxpayer dollars.

3. Admission Policies: Private schools can select students based on academic performance, aptitude tests, or other criteria, while public schools must accept all students within their district. Some private schools may have policies to provide scholarships or financial aid for families who might not be able to afford tuition.

4. Focus on Specific Academic or Cultural Emphases: Private schools can focus on specific academic areas such as arts, sciences, or foreign languages, or they can emphasize a particular cultural, religious, or philosophical orientation. Public schools must offer a broad and balanced curriculum based on state education standards.

5. Smaller Class Sizes: Due to their funding models, private schools often have smaller class sizes than public schools, which can provide more individual attention for students.

6. Extra-Curricular Activities: Private schools may have more resources for extra-curricular activities, clubs, and sports programs. They may also be able to offer unique opportunities like internships, study abroad programs, or special interest classes not available in public schools.";234;10;4;36.3899040222168;13.042937499999997;93.0625

46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters; Ctenophores, also known as Comb Jellies, are marine invertebrates that inhabit the world's oceans. They are most commonly found in coastal areas and open seas worldwide, although they seem to be more abundant in temperate and tropical regions compared to polar ones. Some species of ctenophores can also live in freshwater bodies like lakes and ponds, but these freshwater ctenophores have adapted differently from their marine counterparts.;67;4;2;12.371240139007568;12.539363636363634;86.18181818181819
47;In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?;Brazil; The largest part of the Amazon Rainforest is located in South America, specifically within Brazil. Approximately 60% of the forest lies within this country's borders, making it the custodian of more than half of the world's largest tropical rainforest. Other countries that share portions of the Amazon include Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas department of France).;63;11;1;11.786089658737183;12.7401;87.0
48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;" The European Union (EU) has a bicameral legislative system, which is composed of two distinct yet cooperative institutions:

1. The European Parliament (EP): It is the directly elected body of the EU and represents the voice of the citizens. Composed of 705 members (MEPs), it is responsible for passing legislation in areas under the shared competence of the EU, approving the EU budget, and overseeing the executive branch, which includes the European Commission.

2. The Council of the European Union (also known as the Council of Ministers or simply the Council): It represents the governments of the EU member states. The Council is made up of government ministers from each of the 27 member countries. Each country has one vote, and the President of the Council chairs the meetings. The Council plays a crucial role in the legislative process by adopting laws jointly with the European Parliament.

Both the European Parliament and the Council are essential to the democratic structure of the EU, as they work together to ensure that the policies and decisions made reflect the interests and needs of the citizens within the Union.";186;12;9;27.436241149902344;13.038375000000002;91.66666666666667
49;The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?;Westminster; The powers of the Scottish Parliament, as defined in the Scotland Acts, are devolved from the UK Parliament at Westminster. This means that the Scottish Parliament can legislate as it pleases within the areas for which it has been given competence, so long as these powers aren't already reserved by Westminster (reserved matters). These include areas such as foreign affairs and defense, which are considered to be of exclusive UK-wide concern.;71;18;1;11.368979930877686;12.4714;85.2
