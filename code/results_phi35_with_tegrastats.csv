0;where did mexico win its independence from spain; On September 27 , 1821 the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City , and the following day Iturbide proclaimed the independence of the Mexican Empire , as New Spain was henceforth to be called . The Treaty of Córdoba was not ratified by the Spanish Cortes . Iturbide included a special clause in the treaty that left open the possibility for a criollo monarch to be appointed by a Mexican congress if no suitable member of the European royalty would accept the Mexican crown . Half of the new government employees appointed were Iturbide 's followers . ;"Mexico's struggle for independence was not a singular event with Mexico winning ""independence"" as we might think of it in the context of other nations, but rather a gradual process involving several significant battles and events. The movement against Spanish rule began around this time period, culminating officially on September 16, 1dictly known as Mexican Independence Day (Grito de Dolores).

Here's an overview:

- **Mexico’th elite** sought independence from Spain after growing dissatisfaction with colonial rule and inspired by the American Revolution. The ideas of republicanism spread through Mexico, encouraging people to seek autonomy for their country as well. 
  
- In September 1810, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla delivered a passionate speech in small town Dolores (now La Paz), calling on his parishioners and fellow Mexicans not just to win independence but also social justice – this event is celebrated annually since as Mexico's Independence Day.
  
- Following these events, insurgent groups formed along with leaders like Hidalgo himself, who became a folk hero after he was captured and executed by Spanish authorities in 1811 for his role in inciting rebellion against Spain. His death did not quell the movement instead, it spurred others to continue fighting which eventually led towards independence over years of guerrilla warfare with shifting leadership including leaders like Francisco Villadez and Jose Morelos who managed significant territories during their respective campaigns for freedom from Spanish rule in Central Mexico.
  
- The struggle was not unidirectional, as Spain fought back fiercely to retain control over its colonies under the threat of Napoleon's invasion into Iberia which weakened royal power significantly - aiding these separatist forces considerably more so than would have been possible without this external conflict.
  
- In 1820, in what is known as Plan de Iguala (Plan for Equality), Agustin Iturbide and Jose Morelos agreed to recognize Mexican citizenship with equality between Spaniards and Creoles living within the territory while negotiating a process towards independence. This plan became more popular among those dissatisfied by Spain's harsh treatment of its colonies during this period which was characterized as heavy taxation, religious discrimination against Catholics etc., further fueling unrest in these regions that had seen numerous uprisings since 1803.
  
- Following a revolt led by Iturbide's forces on September 27th (Cry of Anahuac), Spain was left with no choice but to negotiate and agree upon terms for the eventual independence which took shape when in May, after several meetings between both parties involved – Spaniards living within Mexican territory as well - an agreement named Treaty signing at Córdoba finalized official end of Spanish colonial rule over Mexico.
  
- In 1823 with newly minted constitution (Constitución de Apatzingan), Iturbide became emperor but faced internal opposition and dissatisfaction leading him to abdicate his throne in March the same year - giving way for a republic form of government within months after. Mexico was officially recognized as an independent nation on September 27, following its struggle against Spain's colonial reign spanning over three centuries (150 years).
  
In summary: while there isn’t one specific ""location"" where independence could be considered won by the entire country at once due to complexity of events involved across Mexico itself during this period it was through a series actions taken throughout nearly 3 decades that led towards eventual autonomy from Spain, culminating in official recognition as an independent nation on September 27th.

Additionally worth noting is how these battles and political upheavals played out differently across different regions within Mexico themselves - some areas like Texas or California had separate processes with varying timelines for their own eventual breakaway, leading to further conflicts such as the Mexican-American War (1846 – 1847) between US forces & territories which led them into significant parts of current day USA.
  
In essence: Mexico's pathway towards independence from Spain involved many battles and political maneuverings spread out over several years involving different factions within their society - each fighting for better representation, autonomy or even complete secession (as seen elsewhere) which eventually culminated in an independent nation with a new constitution that sought to balance power among various groups present at the time – although struggles continued internally as well afterwards.

If your inquiry is indeed regarding Las Vegas and the specific Venetian Hotel there:

1. It could possibly be a confusion between The Venetian (Las Vegas) with over 2,791 guest room spaces as of early to mid-2023 or other hotels that attempt an Italian theme like Caesar's Palace which has approximately 648 rooms and the Bellagio Hotel & Casino.

3;where did the duffer brothers go to school; The Duffer brothers were born and raised in Durham , North Carolina . They began making films in the third grade using a Hi8 video camera that was a gift from their parents . They attended the Duke School for Children from grades K - 8 , a private suburban school , and then matriculated to the Charles E. Jordan High School , a large Durham public school . They relocated to Orange , California to study film at Chapman University 's Dodge College of Film and Media Arts , where they graduated in 2007 . After writing and / or directing a number of short films , their script for the post-apocalyptic horror film , Hidden , was acquired by Warner Bros. Pictures in 2011 . The brothers directed the film in 2012 , which was released in 2015 . Director M. Night Shyamalan read the script and hired them as writer / producers on the Fox television series Wayward Pines . ;"The information provided does not specify any ""duffer"" brothers or their educational background. If you can provide additional context such as names, time period, location, or field of interest (e.gy sports, academia, etc.), I could attempt a more precise response regarding where these individuals might have gone to school if they are known entities.

If ""duffer"" refers to skilled players in some sport like baseball and you're asking about specific brothers who played professionally or at high levels of college sports:

1. If it concerns professional MLB athletes, identifying the individual team history could lead us towards their alma maters if they went on for higher education after playing minor leagues (which is common in baseball). For instance:
   - **Example**: The Dufner brothers might have attended a college known to produce top-tier pitching talent, such as Yost Academy High School or nearby colleges like Harvard University's Baseball Program. However, without concrete names and identifiable details about these ""duffer"" baseball players/brothers, I cannot provide an exact answer.
   - **Response**: To accurately respond to this inquiry, more specific information would be needed regarding the individuals in question or their accomplishments within a recognized sports organization.
   
2. If 'Duffer' refers to something else (e.g., characters from literature/popular culture), additional context is necessary for identification and research:
   - **Example**: Should these Duffers refer to the comic strip character created by Rube Goldberg, they didn’t go through an educational institution as it was a fictional creation meant solely for humor. Thus their ""school"" would be nonexistent in reality but could have been referenced or inspired within various narratives and jokes across time (the joke itself is often that the character went to 'no school' at all).
   - **Response**: In cases of fictional characters, it’s important to remember they don't attend real schools instead, their educational experiences are derived from creators within a narrative framework.
   
3. If ""Duffer"" is an abbreviation or typo for another name that refers to actual historical figures who attended school:
   - **Example**: Assuming there was confusion with the Duff brothers (if they were prominent enough, their educational background might be documented in biographies and could even have been subjects of local historiography), one would need specific names or additional details. In such cases referencing notable universities like Oxford for certain historical figures' education may become relevant:
     - **Response**: Identifying the correct individuals with whom you are referring will allow us to pinpoint their educational history, which might be rooted in historically renowned institutions if they were educated persons of significance. 
   
In summary, without additional specifics about who these ""Duffer"" brothers (or whomever) may refer to or more detail from the query provided, it is not possible for me to accurately identify their educational background.";453;8;163;63.21515703201294;14.845392857142844;96.58928571428571
4;main character in to kill a mockingbird book; The story takes place during three years ( 1933 -- 35 ) of the Great Depression in the fictional `` tired old town '' of Maycomb , Alabama , the seat of Maycomb County . It focuses on six - year - old Jean Louise Finch ( nicknamed Scout ) , who lives with her older brother , Jeremy ( nicknamed Jem ) , and their widowed father , Atticus , a middle - aged lawyer . Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill , who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer . The three children are terrified yet fascinated by their neighbor , the reclusive Arthur `` Boo '' Radley . The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo , and few of them have seen him for many years . The children feed one another 's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden , and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house . After two summers of friendship with Dill , Scout and Jem find that someone leaves them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place . Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children , but , to their disappointment , he never appears in person . ;"The main character, Atticus Finch, is not present as the protagonist for most of Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" However, his children—Scout (Jean Louise Finch), Jem (Jeremias Finch), and Dill (William Francis Cunningham)—drive much of the plot. Atticus serves as their moral compass throughout the story:

1. Scout – The novel's narrator a six-year old tomboyish girl who learns important life lessons, particularly about empathy and understanding others through her interactions with Boo Radley, an enigmatic neighbor whom she initially fears but ultimately comes to appreciate for his kindness.
2. Jem – Scout's older brother he grapples with the complexities of adult behavior as Atticus tries to defend a black man falsely accused by racism in their town, leading him on an emotional journey that exposes both prejudice and innocence within himself and his community.
3. Dill – A school friend who visits during summers he too is affected significantly when faced with the trial of Tom Robinson as Atticus' defense seems unlikely to succeed against deep-rooted racial biases in Maycomb, Alabama where they live.

While Scout and Jem are central characters through whose experiences unfold much of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" it is their father, Atticus Finch, who serves as the moral backbone driving key lessons about justice, integrity, and human dignity against prejudice in one small town.";220;8;220;32.90381073951721;14.845714285714289;97.14285714285714

6;what type of reaction leads to the production of polymers; The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry . Nylons must specifically include an straight chain ( aliphatic ) monomer . The amide link is produced from an amine group ( alternatively known as an amino group ) , and a carboxylic acid group . The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine , and gives rise to water , the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction . ;"The formation of polymers typically involves a chemical process called polymerization, which can proceed through various mechanisms leading to different types of reactions. The main categories include:

1. **Addition Polymerization (Chain-Growth):** Here monomers add together without the loss of any small moleclaus, creating long chain structures one atom at a time in what is essentially an addition reaction with each growing polymeric species adding to another active site or free radical on neighboring chains. Examples include:
    - **Free-radical Polymerization** where high energy free radicals initiate and propagate the growth of long chain molecules, as seen in polystyrene production from styrene monomers under certain conditions (with peroxides or UV light).
  
2. **Condensation/Step-Growth Polymerization:** These reactions occur when two different types of monomers react to form a bond and release small molecules as byproducts, such as water in the case of polyesters synthesis from dicarboxylic acids (e.g., terephthalic acid) with diols like ethylene glycol or diamine initiators that combine through esterification/amide bond formation under relatively mild conditions without any specific sequence control as in living polymers, which can form block copolymers and have a degree of molecular weight controlled precisely.
    
3. **Ionic Polymerization:** This includes both cationic (positive ion) or anionic (negative ion), where monomers are added to the growing chain end through nucleophilic attack by charged species, as seen in polyisobutylene synthesis from isobutene using a strong acid like hydrogen fluoride.
    
4. **Coordination Polymerization:** Often involves transition metal catalysts and can form both covalent bonds between monomers (similar to addition polymerizations) or three-dimensional network structures, exemplified in the synthesis of polyethylene terephthalate via an ester interchange reaction with a diamine.
    
5. **Ring-Opening Polymerization:** Cyclic monomers open up and link to form linear or branched polymers lactide is converted into Polylactic Acid (PLA) through ring opening by acidic, basic, oxidative catalysts etc., used in many medical applications.
    
The choice of reaction mechanism depends on the monomers involved, desired properties and end-use application as well as economic considerations such as cost efficiency and environmental impact concerning waste products like water or methanol (in some condensation polymerizations). Advanced techniques may also involve living/controlled radical polymerization methods where chain growth can be precisely controlled to obtain specific molecular weight distributions, compositions for block copolymers formation.

Each type of reaction involves unique initiation steps and proceeds with different rate laws which govern the kinetics understanding these aspects is critical when designing industrial processes or novel materials using polymerization methods.";403;10;80;66.78080081939697;14.839779661016937;94.52542372881356
7;when did the one game wild card start; From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series . However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult . The new system was instituted in 1994 ( but first used in 1995 because a players strike canceled the 1994 playoffs ) when Major League Baseball expanded from two to three divisions per league . In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs . In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed . This was the team with the most wins amongst non-division winners . The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league . ;"The ""One Game Wild Card"" concept does not correspond with any established system in major sports leagues as of my knowledge cutoff date. However, you might be referring to a specific rule or structure related to postseason tiebreakers within certain youth leagues, collegiate games, pick-up baseball matches, or an innovative idea from a particular event that was not widely adopted.

For example, in Major League Baseball (MLB), the wild card has been part of their playoff system since 2012 when two teams with the best records outside of division winners compete for a spot in the postseason to maintain interest and competitency throughout the season. If you are asking about another sport or event, please provide more context so I can give an accurate response based on available information up until now.

9;what was the name of shakespeares acting company; The Globe Theatre was a theatre in London associated with William Shakespeare . It was built in 1599 by Shakespeare 's playing company , the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , on land owned by Thomas Brend and inherited by his son , Nicholas Brend and grandson Sir Matthew Brend , and was destroyed by fire on 29 June 1613 . A second Globe Theatre was built on the same site by June 1614 and closed by an Ordinance issued on 6 September 1642 . ;"The primary acting troupe associated with William Shakespeare during his career in London is known as the Lord Chamberlain's Men, which later became The King' extramundane entities like ""the Bard"" or even modern-day actors who might have performed alongside him. However, after Elizabeth I ascended to the throne and due to a change of patronage from the Earl of Derby (a supporter) to Queen Elizabeth herself in 1596, they were renamed The King's Men for several reasons:

1. To reflect their royal sponsorship now under the new monarch’s reign it was seen as prestigious and honorable having a monarchy endorsement which could attract more audiences to patronize them during her rule. This reflected changing political climates where actors were increasingly performing for wealthy patrons or at court, especially when royalty showed interest in the theatre (which they did by Elizabeth's love of plays).

2. By aligning themselves with The Crown public image boosted their reputation and standing within London society a title like 'The King’ Men would have been more palatable to many audiences than that which had previously aligned them closer or associated the troupe (or even Shakespeare himself) as merely an outsider actor.

3. They were also benefiting from this new monarchy-linked patronage by being eligible for certain benefits and privileges, like exclusive performance rights to present specific plays at court – which would not have been available under the previous Chamberlain's Men setup. Thus changing their name could be viewed as a strategy of self-promotion in an evolving theatre scene that saw more competition with other troupes who were also seeking royal patronage and thus, prestige by linking themselves to The Crown they would stand out amongst rivals even if it was just through association rather than direct sponsorship.

It's important though not solely attributed this shift in their name merely because of Elizabeth I’s ascension but considering various socio-political factors at play during that time, such as changing attitudes towards actors and theatre itself – which were becoming increasingly popular among both aristocrats & commoners alike. Hence while it's true these changes helped define them further within this context - they should not overshadow other reasons behind their transition either: like possible conflicts with previous sponsors who may have wanted to distance themselves from such associations, as well or even shifts in audience tastes – something that any company would need mindful about if seeking longevity for its enterprise.

It's also relevant here considering different actors on stage during Shakespeare’s time weren't necessarily considered celebrities rather they were seen more like skilled laborers doing their job - so even though there may not have been an equivalent term used back then, you could argue that by calling themselves The King Men (a title which has historically held great importance within society), Shakespeare and his troupe would be attempting to elevate statuses where possible showing both respect for royalty as well assisting in creating a sense of unity between these two disparate groups - actors & aristocrats alike.

Finally, while the reasons behind this change might seem trivial today given how deeply ingrained 'The Bard' concept is when referring to Shakespeare himself – nevertheless understanding why certain terms were chosen by Elizabethan society could provide valuable insight into their cultural and societal norms - which can then help us further comprehend what made people resonate with specific ideas about fame, success & influence during that era: all of these factors play a role in shaping how one's career progresses over time – something worth noting when assessing historical context alongside current trends.

In summary The King’s Men was the new name adopted by Shakespeare and his acting company after Elizabeth I came to power which signaled an important shift both for them socially & politically - with this change reflective of wider changes within London theatre culture around patronage, public image etc. along these lines its worth examining why actors would opt such titles as 'The King's Men', beyond surface-level implications – while acknowledging that factors like individual ambition (to stand out amongst competitors), potential conflicts with previous sponsors might have also influenced this transition: all providing insight into how their careers unfolded within Elizabethan society.

I hope I managed to provide some clarity on the historical context surrounding these changes and why they matter - remember though there are likely other facets at play here too which could further enrich our understanding!";736;8;84;95.66867518424988;14.84008235294116;96.8

1. **Subscriptions and Licensing Fees**: Publishers often charge authors, freelancers, artists or studios upfront fees to publish a piece of work (books, articles, digital media). These payments are then distributed by the clearinghouse on behdict terms agreed upon beforehand.

2. **Sales Revenues**: After publication and distribution, any profits made from book sales or licensing agreements for other forms of content can be pooled back into a fund which is subsequently allocated to creators based on the pre-negotiated royalties structure managed by clearance entities.

3. **Royalties**: In cases where publishers have an agreement with authors, artists or rights holders for their work being used in various media (such as adaptations into movies and TV shows), these parties would receive a portion of the revenues generated from those uses according to contractual agreements often managed by clearinghouses.

4. **Fundraising**: Some organizations might operate through crowdfunded models where they collect funds directly, which are then distributed as royalties or licensing payments in accordance with the agreed terms of service for content creators and publishers involved.

5. **Government Grants & Aid Programs**: In certain cases—especially relevant during economic hardships like those caused by a pandemic, governments might provide grants or financial aid to support such clearinghouses that play crucial roles in the creative industry's livelihood and distribution.

6. **Donations & Sponsorship**: External fundraising through donations from individuals who believe in supporting artists can also be a source of income for some publishers or content agencies, though this method is less structured than others like royalties payments based on revenue generated by sold works.

7. **Investors & Shareholders**: For privately-owned entities that manage royalty distributions and clearinghouses may rely upon initial investment capital from individuals or businesses interested in supporting the creative industries as well, expecting returns through profits made on their contributions over time if applicable to a publicly traded company.

In case you are referring specifically to an existing service under this name that functions within certain markets (like music publishing), it would be helpful for more precise information about its funding sources and operations by clarifying which country's context or industry sector the question is directed towards, as practices can vary significantly across different regions.";415;9;93;60.57422661781311;14.837603773584897;97.94339622641509
13;how many pages are in the harry potter series; Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93⁄4 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . ;"The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling consists of seven main novels, and it is often published as a collection spanning multiple volumes:

1. ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" (also known as ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’ extruded into book form by Joanne Kardispy) - 224 pages in some editions, but page counts can vary slightly between different publishers.

2. ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" – Around 317-335 pages (similar to other UK/US versions).

3. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" - Approximately between 386–402 pages, depending on publisher's format choices like paper quality or inclusion of extra content such as illustrations.

4. ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" – Generally about 517-539 pages (this also depends heavily on edition variations).

5. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" which has a notably longer page count due to its detailed content, falls into roughly between 850–862 pages in many editions. This book can be quite hefty because it expands extensively on themes like bureaucracy within Hogwarts School and parallels with the real world.

6. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" – Roughly 734 pages, though variations exist based upon publisher’s decisions regarding formatting such as extra illustrations or text additions in some editions (e.g., The Unofficial Guide to Harry Potter).

7. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" – Around 636-654 pages, again varying with different publishing choices across various formats like hardcover vs paperback or inclusion of additional material in some editions (e.g., author's notes/essays).

Note that these page counts can differ slightly due to the reasons mentioned above—variations between publishers and printing processes are common factors influencing physical book dimensions, including length. Moreover, certain special collections might contain extra content like illustrations or annotations by J.K. Rowling herself in some editions which could also affect overall pagination.

Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that there have been various abridged versions of the Harry Potter series available for readers seeking a shorter reading experience without compromising on essential plot elements and character development these often contain fewer pages than their complete counterparts.";346;9;204;56.557395696640015;14.842899999999995;96.5
14;where is the lava stored in a volcano;" A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth . The molten rock , or magma , in such a chamber is under great pressure , and , given enough time , that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it , creating a way for the magma to move upward . If it finds its way to the surface , then the result will be a volcanic eruption ; consequently , many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers . These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth , and therefore most of those known are close to the surface , commonly between 1 km and 10 km down . ";"Inside a volcano, magma (which becomes lava once it reaches the Earth's surface) resides within its plumbing system of chambзуels and conduits. Here are some key components where this molten rock may be found:

1. **Magma Chamber**: Deep beneath the crust lies a large, sizable pool called magma chamber from which eruptions can originate when pressure builds up sufficiently to break through overlying rocks or within shallower conduits leading towards the surface. The composition and size of this reservoir vary significantly between volcanoes but it is often located many kilometers beneath solid ground rock (or crust).

2. **Crater Lake**: At a sub-surface vent, magma may pool in small cavities known as lava dome or within an active summit caldera during non-eruptive periods—the former being more fluid and the latter viscous due to high silica content (rhyolitic composition).

3. **Magma Conduit System**: When magma ascends through conduits, dikes or fissures within a volcano's structure towards its vent(s), it may temporarily pool in these narrow channels before reaching the surface as lava flows during an eruption episode. The speed and style of this migration can vary depending on factors such as magma viscosity (which is governed by temperature, silica content, and volatile concentrations) along with surrounding rock strengths under pressure gradients established within Earth's crust due to buoyancy forces acting upon the less dense molten material.

Once it reaches or nears ground level—or breaks through an existing surface breach such as a vent/crater rim during eruptions (known respectively in Hawaiian volcanology terms as ""pāhoeholes"")–the magma is then termed lava flow and begins its journey along the Earth's exterior via network of fractures, channels or pipe-like structures built by previous outburst events.
 
Keep in mind that these descriptions only apply to volcanoes with liquid rock involved ash plumes are instead generated from fragmented solidified magma (pyroclasts) within subterranean environments where pressures can exceed threshold levels needed for explosive degassing or pyroclastic density currents.
 
Understanding how these materials accumulate, migrate and interact with external conditions remains critical to assess volcanic hazard potentials associated not only with lava flows but also other related phenomena like ash fallout from eruptions occurring within the magma chamber or conduit systems themselves - which can drastically impact surrounding ecosystem health, air quality and human infrastructure stability when they reach surface levels.
 
In summary: though most of a volcano's molten rock remains secluded deep beneath its ground level (within plumbing system components such as magma chamber(s) or conduits), these reservoir regions play essential roles in determining style and characteristics displayed during active outburst events - thereby influencing our ability to monitor, predict eruptions & develop effective mitigation strategies.";438;8;119;67.53119587898254;14.832649999999989;96.65

16;who led the american occupation of puerto rico during the spanish-american war; Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 , ratified on December 10 , 1898 , Puerto Rico was ceded to the United States . Spain had lost its last colony in the Western Hemisphere and the United States gained imperial strength and global presence . The United States established a military government and appointed Miles the first head of the military government established on the island , acting as both head of the army of occupation and administrator of civil affairs . Members of the Spanish forces and civilians who were loyal to the Spanish Crown were allowed to return to Spain . By October 18 , the Spanish withdrawal from Puerto Rico was completed as the final troops left San Juan for Spain . Those who belonged to the Spanish military who decided to stay in Puerto Rico were offered the option by the United States to serve in the newly formed `` Porto Rico Regiment '' . Some took the offer , such as Teófilo Marxuach , a former Lieutenant in the Spanish Army who joined the regiment , and others , such as Capt . Angel Rivero Méndez , declined the offer and retired from the military . ;"The American military presence in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War, which ultimately contributed to its annexation as a U.S territory, was commanded by Major General Nelson A. Miles and later Rear Admiral Williamson DeCordova among other officers who played roles at different times of this conflict:

1. **Major General Nelson Aldrich (later known as ""Nelson"")** - He became the Military Governor after being in command during parts of the war, overseeing not only military matters but also acting to stabilize and administer Puerto Rico under Spanish American War circumstances until formal annexation took place.
   
2. **Major General Nelson A. Miles:** Although primarily known for his service later as a Union general during the Civil War in America, he did command troops that participated in operations against Spain's colonial presence throughout their occupation of Puerto Rico and its other territories at various times. However, specific operational roles should be assessed within broader campaign context rather than isolation to individual leadership on this island territory alone.

3. **Rear Admiral Williamson DeCordova:** As a senior naval officer during the period of American military engagement in Puerto Rico and elsewhere as part of Spanish-American War, he would have been involved with coordinating land forces led by generals like Miles within their joint operations against Spain’sfar-flung empire.
   
It's worth noting that these command roles were a small aspect when compared to the broader U.S.-Spanish conflict and its aftermath, which eventually resulted in Puerto Rico becoming an unincorporated territory of the United States under terms negotiated during peace treaties such as Treaty of Paris (1898), where Spain relinquished control over Cuba, Guam, the Philippines, and by extension influence on places like Puerto Rico.

In historical contexts with multiple leaders or complex administrative setups—particularly those involving military occupations during conflicts outside their home country's direct governance such as this one between America and Spain—it is important to consider a multifaceted chain of command that includes various high-ranking officials, not just single individuals. The occupation was thus more an expression of American expansionism than the specific military leadership at Puerto Rico these officers would have been part but not singularly responsible for leading it as U.S.-occupied territory during this period.";363;12;204;50.63512873649597;14.83622727272727;96.88636363636364
17;who was invited to the parliament of religious in 1893;  The Jain preacher Virchand Gandhi was invited as a representative of Jainism .

Soyen Shaku , the `` First American Ancestor '' of Zen , made the trip .   An essay by the Japanese Pure Land master Kiyozawa Manshi , `` Skeleton of the philosophy of religion '' was read in his absence .   Swami Vivekananda represented Hinduism as a delegate , introducing Hinduism at the opening session of the Parliament on 11 September . Though initially nervous , he bowed to Saraswati , then began his speech with salutation , `` Sisters and brothers of America ! '' . To these words he got a standing ovation from a crowd of seven thousand , which lasted for two minutes . When silence was restored he began his address . He greeted the youngest of the nations on behalf of `` the most ancient order of monks in the world , the Vedic order of sannyasins , a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. !

Henry Jessup addressing the World Parliament of Religions was the first to publicly discuss the Bahá'í Faith in the United States ( it had previously been known in Europe . ) Since then Bahá'ís have become active participants .   Theism or the Brahmo Samaj was represented by Pratap Chandra Majumdar   New religious movements of the time , such as Spiritualism and Christian Science . The latter was represented by Septimus J. Hanna , who read an address written by its founder Mary Baker Eddy .  ;"The Parliament of the World's Religions, an event aimed at promoting interfaith understanding and dialogue among diverse spiritual traditions around the globe, convened for the first time on September 12, 1893. However, it’s important to clarify that in its inaugural gathering there was no formal invitation process as we understand today because organized religious pluralism wasn't widely institutionalized at this stage of history within such large-scale interfaith dialogues specifically aimed for the broader public and various faith communities.

Instead, a wide array of representatives from numerous religions were invited by Hindu philanthropist Ram Mohan Roy to discuss religious reform in India with an eye towards building connections between different spiritual traditions within his country—a precursor conceptualized for the later Parliament sessions held internationally. The 1893 gathering was largely focused on Indian religions and aimed at addressing issues of social reforms, including caste discrimination among Hindus themselves as well as inter-religious understanding within India's diverse religious landscape.

The later Parliament of the World’s Religions that grew in scale with subsequent meetings did involve a more formal process where leaders and representatives from different faith traditions were invited to attend, often organized by various denominational or cultural affiliations interested in interreligious dialogue on an international stage. These events continue today as part of the Parliament's efforts each year at locations like Chicago’s Hull House for a broader audience involving more than just representatives from India but rather speakers and delegates worldwide representing almost every major religious tradition, with additional participation by indigenous spiritual groups.";252;10;307;35.51034164428711;14.835096774193547;96.38709677419355
18;what teams in the nba go to the playoffs;" In September 2015 , the NBA announced changes to the formula used to determine the format of the 2016 NBA Playoffs . The top eight teams in each conference ( East and West ) , ranked in order by win - loss records , qualify for the playoffs . The tie - break criteria for playoff seeding and home - court advantage have also changed ; head - to - head results between the tied teams is the first tie - breaker , and whether a team won its division championship is the second tie - breaker . ";"In the National Basketball Association (NBA), not all individual teams make it into the Playoffs each year, as only a selected group of elite performers qualify based on their regular season record. The specific teams that advance are determined annually after the NBA's Regular Season and Division Championships culminate in April or May before playoff action begins.

Here’s how it generally works: 
1) Each team plays a full-season schedule with multiple home/away games, ultimately finishing either within their respective division (either East or West). The top four teams from each conference qualify for the Playoffs based on winning percentage and record during this phase. These comprise of Eastern Conference Teams like Boston Celtics, Miami Heat, Philadelphia 76ers etc., as well as Western Conference contenders such as Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets among others.
   
2) The teams that qualify then progress through the postseason rounds – first round (Division Finals), conference finals and ultimately culminate in one of two NBA Championships: Eastern or Western Division Champions versus each other for an overall league title. Each series generally follows a best-of format, which means victory occurs when four games are won by either side rather than simply having the higher seeds win three times over lower ones.
   
To find out exactly who made it into this year'supreme basketball showdowns – keep in mind that NBA Playoffs rosters change annually as teams may face injuries, trades and departures during their regular season runs. The list of eligible contenders for a given playoff cycle is usually published by various sports news outlets close to the start date or announced officially through press releases from both league offices and individual team announcements.
   
For current NBA Playoffs teams, I recommend checking with reliable sources such as ESPN's official site (espn.com) for up-to-date standings and rosters at playoff time.";302;9;98;41.04420328140259;14.83725;96.44444444444444
19;when did they stop using knob and tube wiring in homes; Knob - and - tube wiring ( sometimes abbreviated K&T ) is an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings , in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s . It consisted of single - insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities , passing through joist and stud drill - holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes , and supported along their length on nailed - down porcelain knob insulators . Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch , or were pulled into a wall , they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom . The first insulation was asphalt - saturated cotton cloth , then rubber became common . Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength , then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape ( asphalt saturated cloth ) , or made inside metal junction boxes . ;"The phase-out of Knob and Tube (K&T) wiring, which was the standard for electrical installations until around the mid-20th century, varied by region. In general:

1. **North America** – Most communities phased out K&T systems in homes primarily during the 1940s and '50s as modern wiring standards became more prevalent for residential construction due to safety concerns (like fire risks) associated with older methods, advancements of technology allowing safer alternatives like Romex cable which could be pulled through existing structures without needing additional support.

2. **Local Building Codes** – The discontinuation also depended on local building codes and regulations as they evolved over time to mandate more modern installations with grounded wiring, circuit breakers for arc fault protection instead of fuses, among others improvements in electrical safety standards like the National Electrical Code (NEC) revisions.

3. **Property Replacement** – Older homes that still have K&T might not be fully de-energized until they are being completely renovated or demolished since many parts of them remain intact and functional, albeit outdated for modern usage standards. It's also possible some jurisdictions require the removal if a property is to undergo certain types of upgrades (like installing central air conditioning).

4. **Insurance Companies** – In many cases insurance companies began requiring homes with K&T wiring be upgraded due to increased risks, and failure to do so might result in higher premiums or denials for coverage entirely because of the heightened risk potential leading to electrical fires that are hard to trace back.

Generally speaking though by around 1970-80 period most new construction stopped using K&T systems however, older homes with this wiring might still be in use today if they’ve been maintained or modernized over time where necessary for continued safety and functionality compliance to current codes. Always check local regulations as these dates could vary significantly from place to place based on policy changes at the municipal level.";315;11;160;45.61692786216736;14.841299999999999;94.8
20;when did they stop hanging in the us; Hanging has been practiced legally in the United States of America from the nation 's birth , up to 1972 when the United States Supreme Court found capital punishment to be in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution . Four years later , the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling , and in 1976 , capital punishment was again legalized in the United States . Hanging has returned to the states of Washington and New Hampshire . ;"The practice of public executions, including hangings, has been phased out and is no longer a common or legal form of punishment in the United States. The last official hangings occurred throughout different states at various times:

1. **Texas** – Public hanging was officially abolished as a method for capital punishment within Texas by Amendment 20, ratified on June 5, 2011. Before this date, several executions were carried out publicly in the state'dictions history until it became widely regarded as cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution which prohibits excessive bail, fines, and torture—often summarized by its ban on ""cruel and unusual"" penalties.

2. **Mississippi** – The last public execution in Mississippi was performed at Central Correctional Facility near Jackson between 1980-1990 before being replaced with lethal injection, which is currently the primary method of capital punishment within its borders when it's employed (note that there have been exceptions and changes over time).

3. **California** – The state abolished public execution through Proposition 184 in November 2016 however, this primarily addressed life sentences without parole rather than capital punishment itself which remains legal but typically involves lethal injection unless a specific case for hanging is ordered by the court.

In general across all states:
- **Lethal Injection** became widely used and accepted as an execution method postdating earlier methods like electrocution, gas inhalation (carbon monoxide), firing squads, or hangings due to concerns about humaneness and standards of decency. 

Capital punishment has been a topic with significant moral debates across the United States regarding its constitutionality as such, individual states may adopt different methods for carrying out these sentences based on legal challenges and changing societal values:
- **Banning capital punishment** - Some counties in various parts of America have officially banned executions within their jurisdiction. The most notable one is New York City after the death penalty was completely abolished statewide by voters through a referendum held on November 8, 2020 (effective immediately).
  
- **Methodology - Lethal Injection**: This remains today's standard method of execution in most states with lethal injection having largely replaced hanging and other forms as the preferred means due to debates about its relative humanity. However, some cases continue where alternative methods may be requested or imposed depending on legal proceedings (such as nitrogen hypoxia).
  
- **Legislation - The Eighth Amendment**: Courts often review execution protocols against the backdrop of this amendment's prohibition, and some argue that lethal injection—with its chemical components intended to stop breathing—constitutes ""cruel and unusual punishment."" This has led certain states such as Virginia (in 2021) or Montana in a few instances where legal battles are ongoing.
  
- **Death Row Disparity**: Even with the decline of public executions, there have been cases that highlight disparities within capital punishment systems—racial bias and socioeconomic status among these controversial issues affecting how death sentences (and consequently their methodologies) are applied.
  
Public opinion on this matter continues to evolve with discussions around the morality of taking life as a form of justice, which is at odds in some regions due largely to cultural and political differences across America's diverse landscape. It remains crucial for continuous discourse between legal frameworks, moral considerations, human rights perspectives, community standards regarding punishment severity vis-à-vis rehabilitation opportunities within the criminal justice system at large.
  
To sum up: Public execution practices in various states have been abolished by specific legislation or court rulings over time (with different timelines for each state). Today, they're not a part of American jurisprudence due to constitutional considerations and evolving standards around what constitutes humane treatment. The broader debate concerning the death penalty itself—including its methods including lethal injection but excluding public executions such as hanging or firing squads—continues in various courts, communities across America with differing opinions on morality, justice systems' fairness and rehabilitation prospects for convicted felons.";639;8;81;98.77074980735779;14.830499999999983;95.44318181818181
21;the day the earth stood still famous phrase; `` Klaatu barada nikto '' is a phrase that originated in the 1951 science fiction film The Day the Earth Stood Still . The humanoid alien protagonist of the film , Klaatu ( Michael Rennie ) , instructs Helen Benson ( Patricia Neal ) that if any harm befalls him , she must say the phrase to the robot Gort ( Lockard Martin ) . In response Gort relents from destroying the Earth and resurrects Klaatu from death . ;"The iconic and well-known line, ""And I heard a great voice out of the wilderness, thundering from on high,"" is taken from the Book of Revelation (5:9) in the New International Version (NIV) of the Bible. This passage describes how John saw an angel holding seven lamps of fire before God and was commanded to write down what he heard during a powerful voice that echoed through heaven, suggesting divine judgment or communication from above at some point in time symbolized as when ""the earth stood still.""

If you are looking for phrases related specifically to the moment where something significant happens (""when the day/earth stands still""), there isn't an exact match within Revelation. However, this concept of a pause or halt due to divine intervention is metaphorical and not meant as a literal historical event but rather emphasizes the gravity and significance of God’s actions in biblical times:

> ""Then I saw one like a human being sitting opposite him at his right hand on the throne, dressed as a deacon [or] holding the book that is open at the revelation of things to come. And when he heard these words and what followed them, I became afraid, so I fell face downward to the ground."" (Revelation 4:10)

Here, John sees an exalted figure often interpreted as Jesus Christ or a representation thereof during divine judgment rather than literal 'earth standing still.' The fear he felt could be associated with any profound realization about God's purpose and the cosmic scale of biblical events. 

Alternatively, if you seek phrases that resonate more broadly:
- ""When I heard what was being said at heaven"" (Revelation 16:5) – Suggesting a moment where John has witnessed profound divine proclamations or actions happening in the celestial realm.
  
If you are looking for different kinds of famous biblical phrases, there's an endless list that include timeless words like ""The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want,"" from Psalm 23:1 (NIV), and the powerful call to action in James 4:17 (""Be on your guard against all deceitfulness, hypocrisy. Marriage is therefore based on selfish ambition"" - NIV).

Remember that biblical interpretations can vary widely depending on one's denominational belief and scholarly approach to scripture. Different versions of the Bible may use varied wording for these kinds of passages, but their core messages generally remain consistent across translations.";392;8;79;56.12560820579529;14.834204081632645;94.51020408163265
22;what is the purpose of constructing a calibration curve;" In analytical chemistry , a calibration curve , also known as a standard curve , is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration . A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration ; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown , giving an internal standard . ";"The purpose of constructing a calibration curve in analytical chemistry and other scientific fields involves several key objectives:

1. **Determination of Detection Limit (DL)**: A calibration curve helps identify the lowest concentration at which an analyte can be quantified with acceptable precision, known as its detection limit or lower limit of quantification. This is crucial for trace analysis where small quantities are significant.

2. **Quantitation Range Establishment**: It defines the range between linear and non-linear responses that a detector provides when analyzing different concentrations to ensure accurate measurements within this span, known as the calibration or quantitative dynamic range of an instrumentation methodology (like spectrophotometry).

3. **Accuracy Checks**: It enables assessment of systematic errors and can highlight deviations from expected responses at various analyte concentrations to ensure that measurements are both precise and accurate across the entire analysis, not just near a single reference point or within an intermediate concentration range (i.e., beyond the instrument's calibration zone).

4. **Correction for Matrix Effects**: In complex sample matrices where other substances can interfere with analyte detection—such as in biological fluids, environmental samples, and industrial products —a matrix-matched calibration curve is employed to compensate systematically so that the effects of these components are factored into your measurements.

5. **Method Validation**: It serves a critical role during method validation by providing evidence for linearity (or lack thereof), limiting factors, and reproducibility at different concentrations when assessing whether an analytical technique is suitable or not for its intended purpose—like measuring specific analytes in pharmaceuticals.

6. **Sensitivity Evaluation**: The slope of the calibration curve can give insights into how sensitively a detector responds to changes in concentration, which helps optimize detection strategies and instrument settings for best performance relative to an analytic task's requirements (e.g., fast measurement or high precision).

In practice, constructing this graphically represents the relationship between known concentrations of analyte standards prepared under controlled conditions—each with a precisely measured concentration by standard methods such as volumetric analysis in titration—and their corresponding instrumental responses obtained through assay procedures (like UV-Vis spectroscopy or mass spec). The data points from these analyses are then plotted on an XY graph, where the independent variable is analyte concentration and dependent response could be absorbance for a colorimetric analysis. By fitting appropriate trends to this plot—linearity being common in many cases but not always (e.g., needing logarithmic transformation), quadratic or sigmoidal curves might apply depending on system behavior at low/high concentrations and specific detector characteristics —the calibration curve comes into existence, ready for use as a quantitative tool within the analytical process flow when sample analysis is conducted in unknowns.

Once established with high precision across its chosen range of interest—and rigorously validated following protocol stipulations (e.g., using certified reference materials and replicate measurements) —the curve acts like an anchor, serving as a critical foundation for subsequent analyses whereby sample concentrations can be inferred from the measured instrumental response by back-calculating along or interpolating on this previously determined relationship between concentration levels (e.g., via calibration software in spectrophotometers) and their consequent detection signals, ultimately contributing to reliable quality control within a lab setting as well as regulatory compliance where specified limits for analytes must be met with high certainty.

In summary, constructing such curves is not just an academic exercise but rather the bedrock upon which quantitative methodologies in laboratories rest—enabling them to yield data that are defensible from a technical and regulatory perspective when applied within real-world contexts where precision measurements often carry significant consequences.";577;9;73;85.40628552436829;14.830421052631563;95.80263157894737

The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia and Europe . The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road ( s ) . ;"The Silk Road was an ancient network of trade routes that connected the East and West, facilitating not only commerce but also cultural interactions. It traversed through various terrains including deserts, mountains, and steppes across Asia:

1. Starting in China – The main part began from cities like Xi'an (Chang’an), which was historically the capital of several Chinese dynasties where trade started or ended with Asian merchants transporting goods overland towards Central Asia, Middle East, and beyond into Europe via various branch routes that eventually merged.
   
2. Through Central Asia – The road passed through a variety of terrains in countries like Kazakhstan (Turkistan region), Uzbekistan (Samarkand/Bukhara regions) where cities along the way became bustling centers for trade and cultural exchange, with caravans often consisting of numerous trading parties from diverse backgrounds.
   
3. To The Middle East – In Iran’s Khurasan region today'supreferring to Khorasan province that covers parts or modern-day northeast Iran (Taybad city) and southeast Afghanistan, merchants continued their journey towards the Persian Gulf cities like Bushehr before reaching further into South Asia.
   
4. Across The Indian Subcontinent – Some routes ventured through what is now Pakistan or India important hubs included Kandahar in present-day southern Afghanistan and Taxila, known for its rich archaeological finds today situated within the Islamic Republic of Pakistan near modern Rawalpindi city where trade continued with local merchants.
   
5. Ending In The Middle East/Europe – From here goods were often transported by sea to cities like Alexandria in Egypt or Constantinople (now Istanbul), which served as key Mediterranean ports for the distribution of silk and other tradable items into Europe, from where they would be distributed throughout much larger markets.
   
6. Extended Routes – Beyond these core routes were many side trails that connected different regional trade networks within Asia itself some led further east towards Southeast Asian cities such as Khotan and Dunhuang in China’s Xinjiang region, while others ventured south to India'soverland trading centers.
   
7. Alternative Sea Routes – Additionally, there were alternative sea routes used for transportation of goods from the Indian Subcontinent towards Europe bypassed direct overland Silk Road travel they often involved navigating through Arabian Peninsula waters or around Africa's Cape Colony (or Horn).
   
On a traditional world map depicting these landscapes, you would trace outlines of China’s eastern coastline and then proceed northwards along the Hexi Corridor until reaching present-day Gansu province in Northwest. From there following through into Inner Mongolia or further eastward across Xinjiang towards Kashgar before crossing Tajikistan'sto Turkmenia, where it intersected with Persian routes heading southwards via the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara within modern Uzbekistani territories. Then west from there on into Afghanistan’s Hazarah plateau region around Herat to connect up further downstream towards Pakistan'strade leading directly or indirectly back out through Baluchi territory till reaching Iranian border crossings near present-day Khorasan province, and then northeastwards along the Silk Road corridor into Kazakhstan’s Turkistan region before terminating at sea ports like Bushehr in southern coastal Persia or even further up to Constantinople/Istambul.
   
The complexity of this trade network can make it difficult on traditional maps however, more specialized historical route mapping software (or using online tools) should give clearer depictions when visualizing the expanse and multiple branches covered by what was once known as The Silk Road across Asia's varied landscapes.

26;what's the difference between tweedle dee and tweedle dum; Tweedledum and Tweedledee are fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking - Glass , and What Alice Found There . Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom . The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800 . The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways , generally in a derogatory context . ;"""Tweedle Dee"" and ""Tweedle Dum"" are phrases that sound similar to each other, often used in a playful or humorous context. They might not have specific established meanings like some idioms but can be interpreted as having onomatopoeic qualities where the repetition mimics sounds (like dits and dahs of Morse code) – they could evoke an image similar to ""tweedle-dee weelp"" with each syllable suggesting a clicking sound.

Here's how you might think about them:

1. **Variation in Sound**: The difference between the two phrases is likely phonetic, where 'Dee' ends softly as it does at the end of ""deed,"" and ‘Dum’ sounds more abrupt or heavy like a knocking sound (similar to how one would say “dud”).
   
2. **Rhythmic Differences**: When spoken, they have different rhythms which could affect their use in poetry (""tweet-DEE"" vs ""TWEEDLE dUM""), songs or even casual conversation for comedic timing and effect (like a punchline). 
   
3. **Psychological Impact**: Depending on the context, saying one over another might subtly alter the emotional response—the softer ending of ""dee"" could feel gentler while 'dum' with its harder consonant sound can be perceived as more emphatic or insistent.
   
4. **Cultural References**: If they come from a specific song, book title, movie line, etc., the differences might refer to variations in lyrics or dialogue where each word would carry different emotional weight and connotations within that context. 

In literature or conversation without additional information about their use case (e.g., if these phrases come from a particular piece), it is largely up to interpretation, with people attributing whatever humoristic nuances they want based on sound patterns alone—a playful wordplay of sorts. If this phrase has specific meaning in some culture or context not widely recognized outside that scope, providing more details might help clarify the differences for you.";298;9;85;47.27289342880249;14.832878048780486;95.21951219512195
27;what do the lyrics mean to lady marmalade; Labelle 's version of `` Lady Marmalade '' was produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham . It was released in November 1974 from Nightbirds , their first album after signing with Epic Records . Patti LaBelle sang lead vocals on `` Lady Marmalade '' with backing vocals being contributed by bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash . The song is best known for the French lyric `` Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? '' ( English : `` Would you like to sleep with me tonight ? '' ) in the refrain . `` Lady Marmalade '' is a song about a prostitute , although Patti LaBelle , the lead female vocal of the band , was completely oblivious to its overall message , saying : `` I did n't know what it was about . I do n't know French and nobody , I swear this is God 's truth , nobody at all told me what I 'd just sung a song about . '' ;"Lady Marmalade is a song by the band Labelle, which features lead vocals from Ann Reilly (Patti LaBelle). The song was featured in the soundtrack of the film ""Mommie Dearest."" When interpreting lyrics for their meaning to Lady Marmalade or Patti LaBelle specifically—or any artist's interpretation—it is essential firstly, due respect and understanding towards how artists may connect with these words.

Here are some possible interpretations of the song ""Lady Marmalade"" by Ann Reilly/Patti LaBelle:

1. Empowerment: The lyrics might reflect a theme about being confident in one's skin, body positivity and empowering oneself to stand out as who they truly are without any reservations or shame—a universal message that many women resonate with regardless of the artist delivering it.

2. Self-love: The song could be highlighting love for self amidst a society often focused on external appearances and judgmental attitudes towards different body types, especially among those within marginalized communities where these issues are prevalent—a call to appreciate oneself from the inside out rather than based soledictory beauty standards.

3. Resistance: The song could be interpreted as a form of resistance against societal expectations and pressures that often dictate behavior, especially for women who have been historically objectified or whose identities fall outside conventional norms—an assertion to defy these constraints with one's authentic self-expression (whether in terms of fashion choices like makeup/fashion style mentioned within the song).

4. Joyful expression: Lady Marmalade is a fun and upbeat track, so its lyrics could be seen as an encouragement for joyous living—celebrating what makes you unique rather than dwelling on conformity or external expectations that may lead to self-doubt (as expressed in the opening refrain of ""Lady Marmalade"").

For Patti LaBelle specifically, her rich history and career as an artist with soulful music could add additional layers. As someone who has had a longstanding presence within R&B/soul genre—and whose body itself is often viewed in connection to beauty standards of the time (which have evolved significantly)—her interpretation might also be imbued with personal narrative and experiences that resonate deeply beyond just surface-level understanding:

1. Personal journey: LaBelle's music has always been about her own life stories, which are often filled with struggle for acceptance in the face of societal norms—her lyrics could be viewed as a reflection on these personal journeys towards self-acceptance and liberation that many find relatable.
2. Representative voice: As an African American woman who broke into mainstream music during times when opportunities were limited for people from her demographic, LaBelle's art may carry deeper messages about cultural identity—her interpretation could include elements of this experience in the context of self-expression and societal acceptance that goes beyond just appearance.
3. Feminist statement: In a broader sense, Lady Marmalade might also serve as an implicit feminist stance against objectification it's about embracing one’s own sexuality rather than being controlled by society (both in the song and through LaBelle). Her interpretation could then be seen within this framework of challenging sexism.
4. Artistic identity: As a successful performer herself, Patti may have also conveyed to her audience that maintaining one's personal flair—be it with makeup or fashion style as mentioned in the song’s lyrics – is an essential aspect not only for entertainment but also self-identity and agency.

Interpretations can always be subjective, influenced by cultural context, lived experiences of both artist(s) involved, personal connections to certain themes within a piece, among many other factors however, these potential interpretations offer one perspective on the song’s lyrics when considering Lady Marmalade and Patti LaBelle.

Note: While I've tried my best here based upon available information about Ann Reilly/Patti LaBellie, without direct quotes from her explanating what she intended with this specific lyric or deeper insights into how it speaks to her personally could provide a more nuanced understanding of the interpretation.";630;8;171;93.8950777053833;14.829469879518056;97.01204819277109
28;who was the actress that played tony montana's sister; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio ( born November 17 , 1958 ) is an American actress and singer . She made her Broadway debut in the 1980 revival of West Side Story , and went on to appear in the 1983 film Scarface as Al Pacino 's character 's sister , Gina Montana . For her role as Carmen in the 1986 film The Color of Money , she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress . Her other film roles include The Abyss ( 1989 ) , Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves ( 1991 ) , and The Perfect Storm ( 2000 ) . In 2003 , she was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for the Broadway revival of Man of La Mancha . ;"In the movie ""Scarface"" (1983), directed by Brian De Palma and based on the novel by Armitage Shem, Helena Bonham Carter plays Norma, who is not Tony Montana’s sister but his former love interest. The character of Tracy, whom Norman (""Tony"") Montana's wife Cleo becomes infatuated with after her husband disappears in Miami Heat, was played by Michelle Pfeiffer she does not have a sibling relationship to him within the film’dict plotline or script.

There seems to be some confusion here—it sounds like there might have been an alternate interpretation of Tony Montana's relationships from another adaptation if any such version exists outside mainstream portrayals, but as per widely recognized depictions and adaptations up until my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023:

- Helena Bonham Carter is not known for playing a character related to Tony Montana.
  
- Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role of Cleopatra ""Tracy"" Baltimore, who becomes pregnant with his child after he leaves her stranded in Miami due to an assassination plot against him but isn't portrayed as his sister either by script or cinematic interpretation.";179;9;133;26.230134963989258;14.832409090909094;93.36363636363636
29;when does one flew over the cuckoos nest take place; One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement and deep changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America . The 1960s began the controversial movement towards deinstitutionalization , an act that would have affected the characters in Kesey 's novel . The novel is a direct product of Kesey 's time working the graveyard shift as an orderly at a mental health facility in Menlo Park , California . Not only did he speak to the patients and witness the workings of the institution , but he voluntarily took psychoactive drugs , including mescaline and LSD , as part of Project MKUltra . ;"The phrase ""one flies over another'thy nest"" is metaphorical and not indicative of a specific event with set timing. If you are referring to birds, like cuckoos which may have nests in various locations depending on the season or time period (such as breeding times), it could occur during their mating seasons when they might be more active outdoors searching for new territories or food sources:

- In many bird species including some types of Cuculus, this activity can increase around spring and summer months. For instance, the European cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) often breeds in early to midsummer when they lay their eggs directly into other birds' nests for incubation—a phenomenon known as parasitism or brood parasitism since it involves relying on another species to raise offspring.
  
- However, if ""one flies over the cuckoo’s nest"" is taken in a more colloquial sense and not related directly to bird behavior, this could refer symbolically to someone who intrudes into or disrupts an existing group (nest) – it would have no specific 'occurrence time' as such situations can happen at various times.

For further clarity on the literal interpretation of birds—please provide additional context so I may offer a more precise answer if applicable, but generally speaking, avian activities like searching for nests are seasonally driven and occur throughout different periods in their life cycle rather than being associated with one particular 'occurrence time'.";233;10;122;31.827916383743286;14.822740740740743;94.70370370370371
30;types of writs in the constitution of india;  The writ of prohibition is issued by a higher court to a lower court prohibiting it from taking up a case because it falls outside the jurisdiction of the lower court . Thus , the higher court transfers the case to itself .   The writ of habeas corpus is issued to a detaining authority , ordering the detainer to produce the detained person in the issuing court , along with the cause of his or her detention . If the detention is found to be illegal , the court issues an order to set the person free .   The writ of certiorari is issued to a lower court directing that the record of a case be sent up for review , together with all supporting files , evidence and documents , usually with the intention of overruling the judgement of the lower court . It is one of the mechanisms by which the fundamental rights of the citizens are upheld .   The writ of mandamus is issued to a subordinate court , an officer of government , or a corporation or other institution commanding the performance of certain acts or duties .   The writ of quo warranto is issued against a person who claims or usurps a public office . Through this writ the court inquires ' by what authority ' the person supports his or her claim .  ;"In India, while Writs are not explicitly mentioned under Article 32 (which provides for remedies to enforce Fundamental Rights), they have been interpreted and used by the Indian judiciary based on its understanding. Here is a list reflecting various types of writs in use:

1. **Habeas Corpus** - This Writ mandates that no one can be held unlawfully or without proper legal process, ensuring liberty against arbitrary arrest. It commands production before the court to verify legality and reasonablenency for imprisonment.

2. **Mandamus (Vacatio Legis)** – A directive issued by a superior Court ordering an inferior body such as government department or lower courts to perform its non-discretionary duties, essentially compelling public authorities not acting within their jurisdiction and powers to act in these instances.

3. **Probationem Superior Mandamus (Mandatory Writ)** – It is used when an authority refuses a duty that’s mandatory under the law or Constitution. The Court instructs them unequivocally not just, but also commands performance of such duties with immediate effect and supervision until compliance ensures public interest service delivery to citizens effectively without arbitrariness in discretionary power misuse.

4. **Certiorare** – This writ is issued by a higher court directing the lower courts or tribunals quo-warranto, request them not to proceed further with any case because it’s beyond its jurisdiction and hence outside mandate of lawful authority for hearing cases on that subject matter under consideration.

5. **Quo Warranto** – The writ is used by the Supreme Court as a control mechanism when state officials or public servants, whose functions are defined in Law Act, exceed their official powers to take undue actions without legal sanction and accountability causing violations of Fundamental Rights against citizens’ interests for which they were not appointed.
   
6. **Essential Commercial Interests Writ (Commandeering)** – It ensures that the State does not misuse its monopolistic powers by controlling private commercial or business enterprises, thereby violating rights of individuals to freely conduct their trade and commerce without unreasonable interference from state.
   
7. **Public Interest Litigation (PIL)** – It allows a public-spirited individual(s), NGO's , corporate entities or group can approach the higher courts for redressal of matters affecting broad societal interest and rights, even when no direct personal injury has occurred to any one person.
   
8. **Judicial Review** – This is not an explicit writ but a significant principle wherein Higher Courts review Lower Court Judgments on the basis whether these decisions have violated Constitutional principles or Fundamental Rights, even when no specific remedy request has been filed by anyone in lower courts for judiciary to interfere.
   
These writs are derived from Article 32 of Indian constitution which states: 'Where any person should be deprived of right to life and personal liberty or property without due process of law, the State shall not refrain its authority'. The Supreme Court in various landmark judgments has interpreted these principles extensively.
   
Remember that India’s legal system is largely based on common laws thus some writ remedy mechanisms might differ somewhat from jurisdictions with a civil or mixed law systems like France, Germany etc., where similar concepts exist but not exactly termed as 'writ'. Hence the exact structure and interpretation can vary according to case specific circumstances.";531;8;229;77.02203750610352;14.827941176470576;96.02941176470588
31;when can a writ of mandamus be issued; Mandamus ( `` We command '' ) is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a superior court , to any government subordinate court , corporation , or public authority , to do ( or forbear from doing ) some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do ( or refrain from doing ) , and which is in the nature of public duty , and in certain cases one of a statutory duty . It can not be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision . For example , it can not be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made , but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications . ;"A writ of mandamus is an order from a court to a government official, agency, or other designated entity requiring the performance of a duty that is already required by law. Here are some conditions under which a writ of mandarius may typically be issued:

1. **Existence of Specific Duty**: There must exist a clear legal obligation for the defendant to perform an act this cannot simply be discretionary, but rather should reflect what is required by statute or common law.

2. **No Alternative Remedy Available**: The court will only issue mandamus if there's no other adethy sufficient legal remedy that can achieve the same result to compel action from a governmental entity or official, such as injunction or damages.

3. **Clear and Undisputed Right of Action**: It must be clear what specific act is being demanded by petitioner ambiguity may prevent issuance because courts cannot order performance when the required duty isn't specified with enough precision to identify actionable conduct.

4. **Petitioner Has Standing or Capacity to Request Mandamus**: The individual requesting mandamus must have a direct and personal interest in performing this specific act, showing that they are an appropriate party seeking the order (either acting on their own behalf or for those whom they represent).

5. **No Discretionary Act Required**: Mandamus cannot compel discretion if carrying out a particular duty involves judgment and choice by the official, mandamus will not issue because it would interfere with administrative autonomy to make policy decisions (a principle often referred to as ""judicial overstepping"").

6. **Immediate Harm is Present or Likely**: Mandatory orders are usually for immediate action where delay could result in harm that cannot be remedied by other means, such a situation might prompt the issuance of mandamus due to urgency and need for swift relief. 

7. **No Public Interest Harm is Conferred By Compliance or Non-compliance**: The court considers whether complying with its order would serve public interest generally speaking, if following through on an immediate duty aligns positively with the community's welfare and does not lead to negative consequences for society.

Writ of mandamus is considered extraordinary remedy in civil procedure because it directly controls actions by a government body or official that are typically left up to discretion within their duties, so such writings tend only be issued when all other legal options have been exhausted and circumstances demand immediate action without delay. In criminal law contexts where individual liberty interests might come into play (e.g., unlawful detention), the issuance criteria may differ due to additional constitutional considerations surrounding personal freedoms that take precedence over mandatory actions by public officials.

It's also important for petitioners seeking a writ of mandamus to ensure they comply with procedural rules, which often include providing evidence and argumentation supporting their request in the appropriate court having jurisdiction (typically state or federal). Courts may grant this extraordinary relief only when all these conditions are satisfied.";484;8;148;67.61745810508728;14.824399999999988;97.0
32;what is an honorable discharge from the marines; To receive an honorable discharge , a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for his or her service . Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct , and who complete their tours of duty , normally receive honorable discharges . However , one need not complete a term of service to receive an honorable discharge , provided the reason for involuntary discharge is not due to misconduct . For instance , service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable , regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty , provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards . Similarly , service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force ( RIF ) typically receive an honorable discharge , assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards . ;"An ""honorable discharge"" from the Marine Corps (USMC) refers to a type of separation where service members are released with distinction for their conduct, performance in duty, or accomplishments while serving. Here's what it typically means:

1. **Moral Conduct** - Service personnel have conducted themselves honorably and maintained integrity throughout their military career. This includes adhering to the Marine Corps values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment at all times without infraction or misconthy fairness with superiors or peers alike.
   
2. **Dutiful Service** - Individuals who receive an honorable discharge have demonstrated competence in their duties while serving they've performed satisfactorily, often exceeding the expectations of performance and responsibility placed upon them during service time.
  
3. **Military Discipline** – Members maintain discipline throughout their term with proper respect for authority at all times within regulation guidelines without disciplinary infractions that could lead to a less favorable discharge type, such as an under honorable or dishonorable one (involving conduct unbecoming of service members).
   
4. **Completion Under Honor** – It implies the member has completed their obligations and responsibilities with honesty throughout their time in active duty—whether voluntarily leaving, being medically discharged for reasons not related to misconduct (like physical or psychological conditions), reaching mandatory retirement age if applicable, etc.
   
5. **Recommendation** – An honorable discharge is often accompanied by positive recommendations from commanders and superiors who believe the individual has served with distinction worthy of commendation rather than reprimand for misconduct or underperformance issues that would lead to less favorable classifications like General, Other Than Honorable (OTH), Bad Conduct Discharge.
   
6. **Reputation and Record Maintenance** – The individual’s record of service is clean—without significant disciplinary actions, criminal convictions while in the military unless such records directly relate to misconduct or breach serious codes (which would negate honorable discharge eligibility). 
   
7. **Transition Assistance and Support** – This type of separation also includes appropriate transition support from service members as they reintegrate into civilian life, which often comes with a range of benefits such as job placement programs or education assistance tailored to veterans leaving the military under an honorable condition.
   
An Honorable Discharge is one that opens up more favorable opportunities for ex-military individuals in terms of employment and other aspects related post-service life, including eligibility for certain government benefits like VA education or healthcare services based on their discharge status alone. 

For further details regarding how a Marine might be released from service with an Honorable Discharge or the specific implications thereof, one should refer to military regulations and speak directly with appropriate personnel within veteran affairs organizations for precise guidance tailored towards individual circumstances of separation.";435;8;161;65.87269115447998;14.826706896551716;94.96551724137932
33;when did the first us state legalize weed; The legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state - level prohibition in the early 20th century , with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937 . Starting with Oregon in 1973 , individual states began to liberalize cannabis laws through decriminalization . In 1996 , California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis , sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016 . In 2012 , Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for recreational use . ;"The first US state to legalize marijuana for recreational use was Colorado, with the passage of Initiative 001 (commonly known as Amendment 64) on November 6, 2ized in December. The regulation and retail sales began in January 2021 after necessary licensing processes were completed by businesses seeking to enter this emerging market legally.

34;where did the settlers of new hampshire come from;" Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the early 17th century , and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century . Prior to English colonization of the area , it was inhabited by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes . The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower . It set precedents but never grew large . A large - scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies . Friction with the natives erupted in the high - casualty King Philip 's War in the 1670s . Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced ; dissenters were exiled . The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter . Most people were farmers . Businessmen established wide - ranging trade links , sending ships to the West Indies and Europe , and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts . These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 . ";"The settlers who came to establish what would become New Hampshire in the early colonial period primarily originated from three regions: England, Europe (particularly Scotland and France), and other parts of North America. The settlement history is complex due to various waves of immigration over time influenced by economic opportunities, religious freedimission hopes, or escape from political turmoil back in their home countries.

1. Early English Settlements: New Hampshire was first settled primarily through migration along the Atlantic coastal route beginning around 1623 when John Mason established a fishing and trading post at what is now Portsmouth, with additional settlers arriving from other parts of Eastern England over time. Many were Puritans seeking religious freedom or economic opportunity away from persecution in their home country during the early Colonial era (17th century).

2. Scots-Irish and French Exiles: The 18th century brought significant Scottish immigration, particularly of dissenters fleeing oppressive laws against Presbyterianism or Catholics from Ulster in Ireland seeking land to farm and religious tolerance (most notably the Scotch Irish settlers who settled along present-don't state lines with Massachusetts).

3. French Canadians: Throughout colonial America, there was also a stream of refugees fleeing political turmoil or persecution from Quebec in Canada due to events like the Acadian expulsion (the Grand Dérangement) during which many French-speaking settlers found their homes uninhabitable and sought shelter further south.

4. English Sea Port Town: Inland, along rivers including those draining into Lake Winnipesaukee – a freshwater body that would become New Hampshire's largest lake - settlement began from the 17th century with small farming communities being established mainly by British subjects seeking fertile land for agriculture.

5. Other Europeans: In addition to these primary groups, various European immigrants came during this period in search of economic opportunities and religious freedom – including Germans (particularly Pennsylvania Dutch from the Palatinate region), Irish Catholics escaping Potato Famine or political strife, French Canadians seeking refuge after expulsion by British authorities.

6. Indigenous Peoples: It's important to note that indigenous peopll living in present-day New Hampshire at the time of European colonization were decimated due primarily to disease brought over from Europe and also displaced as settlers expanded their settlement across North America, causing major changes not only demographically but culturally for those communities.

So while a significant portion came directly or indirectly via England – with Scottish immigrants being particularly influential in shaping early New Hampshire culture due to shared language and cultural traditions - the history of settlement is multi-faceted reflecting an influx from various parts across Europe, as well as refugees coming from Canada.";429;9;208;62.820722818374634;14.82441818181817;95.98181818181818
35;when does gone with the wind come on tv; The film received its world television premiere on the HBO cable network on June 11 , 1976 , and played on the channel for a total of fourteen times throughout the rest of the month . It made its network television debut in November later that year : NBC paid $5 million for a one - off airing , and it was broadcast in two parts on successive evenings . It became at that time the highest - rated television program ever presented on a single network , watched by 47.5 percent of the households sampled in America , and 65 percent of television viewers , still the record for the highest rated film to ever air on television .

Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986 , but the deal did not include the television rights to Gone with the Wind , which were still held by CBS . A deal was struck in which the rights were returned to Turner Entertainment and CBS 's broadcast rights to The Wizard of Oz were extended . It was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System : Turner Network Television ( 1988 ) and Turner Classic Movies ( 1994 ) . It debuted on videocassette in March 1985 , where it placed second in the sales charts , and has since been released on DVD and Blu - ray Disc formats . ;"""Gone with the Wind,"" based on Margaret Mitchell's novel, has been adapted into various television formats over the years. The most notable adaptation is a mini-series that originally aired in two parts:

1. **Theatrical Mini-Series (1980):** This version starred Olivia de Havilland and was first shown on CBS from November 3, 1980, to December 24, with reruns following for several months thereafter. It received critical acclaim but is not commonly available in contemporary TV lineups due to its age.

For more recent or streaming options:
- Depending on your location and current platform availability (like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video), you might find various versions of ""Gone with the Wind"" either for rentals/purchases through these services or available as part of their library if they hold rights to stream it. Always check licensed streaming providers' catalogs in your region since availability can change over time and may vary by location.
- Occasionally, older films like this might be featured on specialty channels that focus on classic movies these are also worth checking out as temporary options for viewing the film at home or through their online platforms if they provide such services to subscribers (like Hulu+Watch Free).

Remember always to ensure you're watching legally when accessing older television shows, and be aware that licensing agreements frequently change.";216;9;258;30.26703190803528;14.825423076923077;97.07692307692308
36;the three pillars of the westphalian constitution of world politics are; Westphalian sovereignty , or state sovereignty , is the principle of international law that each nation - state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory . External powers should not interfere in another country 's domestic affairs . Each state , no matter how large or small , has equal rights to sovereignty . The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states . The United Nations Charter states that `` nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . '' ;"The concept often referred to as ""Westphalia"" in discussions about international relations and law is derived from two key principles established during the Peace of Westphalia, which consisted of a series of treaties signed between May and October 1648. These agreements ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe (particularly involving Central European conflicts) and marked an essential point for state sovereigthy concepts within international politics today:

1. **Sovereignty** - The Peace of Westphalia is considered a foundational event that established the legal concept where each nation-state has sovereign control over its territory, free from external intervention in domestic affairs by other states. This principle suggests no state should meddle with another’s internal issues and governance structure under normal circumstances (excluding universally recognized normative exceptions such as crimes against humanity).
   
2. **Territorial Integrity** - The agreements also affirmed the territorial boundaries of various principalities, duchies, bishoprics, free imperial cities, and empires that were in existence at the time—essentially recognizing their sovereignty over distinct territories without external claims or interferences.
   
3. **Legal Equality Among States** - Westphalia contributed to a fundamental understanding of states' equality under international law, which means all recognized political entities have equal legal status and rights on the world stage regardless of their size, power, culture, religion, etc., though in practice this has been challenged by disparities between nations.
   
These pillars formed the bedrock for Westphalia constitution (though not a true 'constitution' like those within nation-states), which essentially provided structures that underpin modern international law and relations as we understand them today, particularly emphasizing state sovereignty, territorial boundaries respected by other nations, and legal equality amongst these entities.
   
In contemporary discourse however, some scholars argue against this interpretation of the Westphalian principles due to shifts in political structures since then (such as transnational corporations with significant power), changing norms around human rights that can supersede state sovereignty and other factors. However, these three founding tenets remain integral components when discussing international law today – notably how states interact within a complex system of global relations governed by rules meant to promote peaceful coexistence while maintaining their independence as self-governing entities on the world stage.";356;11;87;51.820045948028564;14.829333333333329;96.06666666666666
37;what type of genetic mutation is huntington's disease;" HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , although up to 10 % of cases are due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results . ";"Huntington's Disease (HD) is caused by a specific type of genetic mutation known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This occurs within the HTT gene, which encodes for the protein huntingtin. In individuals without Huntington’s disease, this CAG segment that codes for glutamine (CAG-->Q) is repeated between 10 to more than 35 times in a healthy genome however, those with HD often have many additional repeats – sometimes over hundreds or even thousands of copies.

The normal range for the number of CAG trinucleotide repeat lengths within this gene varies significantly among different individuals and is largely stable when transmitted from one generation to another (transmission stability). However, once a certain threshold — generally considered around 36 repeats in most cases – crosses into an expanded range beyond the normal maximum limit of repetition for healthy carriers (also referred as pre-mutation), it leads typically towards expansion when passed on from parents with HD to offspring.

The excessive CAG repeat length results in a longer polyglutamine tract within huntingtin protein, which becomes abnormally folded and tends to form aggregates inside neurons (particularly affecting the brain's motor regions). These misfolded proteins accumulate over time, disrupt normal cellular functions leading eventually to neurodegeneration characteristic of Huntington’s Disease. This pathological process ultimately results in progressive loss of cognitive function and movement control among other symptoms associated with the condition.

The exact mechanism by which these expanded repeats result in neuronal death is still a subject of intensive research, but it's generally believed that abnormal proteins interfere directly or indirectly (by triggering inflammatory responses) and contribute to cellular stress within affected cells causing apoptosis – programmed cell death.

So the genetic mutation in Huntington’s Disease is a dominant-negative mechanism wherein expanded CAG repeats cause pathological production of misfolded huntingtin protein, disrupting neuronal functions and eventually leading to progressive neurodegenerative effects seen clinically as motor impairments along with cognitive deficits. It’s also important to note that the severity or onset age can vary significantly among those affected by this mutation due to differences in repeat length, indicating variability of phenotypic expression (a phenomenon often referred to as anticipation).

Keep in mind though: while genetic testing for HTT gene expansions is available and essential for diagnosis confirmation especially before planning a family – given its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with complete penetrance, meaning almost every affected individual will show symptoms if the mutated copy of this gene inherited -- not all individuals who have an expanded CAG repeat develop Huntington's Disease. Some may remain entirely asymptomatic (manifesting no clinical signs), but they still carry a risk for transmission to their offspring, hence genetic counseling is highly recommended in cases where the disease occurs within families or among individuals with relevant ethnic backgrounds associated higher prevalence of this mutation type.

Currently there's ongoing research aimed at potential therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathological aspects induced by misfolded huntingtin protein and/or modulating the effects related to repeat expansions, but as yet no cure or approved treatment can halt disease progression.";499;8;191;75.35936260223389;14.827208955223869;96.02985074626865
38;who does the universal declaration of human rights apply to; During World War II , the Allies adopted the Four Freedoms -- freedom of speech , freedom of religion , freedom from fear , and freedom from want -- as their basic war aims . The United Nations Charter `` reaffirmed faith in fundamental human rights , and dignity and worth of the human person '' and committed all member states to promote `` universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language , or religion '' . ;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) applies universally and is intended for all people, without discrimination. It was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris on December 10, 1зу, as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations regarding human rights. The UDHR proclaims that:

- Everyone is entitled to these basic rights simply because they are human beings regardless of their nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, language, or any other status. 
- These rights apply equally and universally in times both of peace and armed conflict governments have the responsibility for protecting these rights without discrimination to everyone within its jurisdiction (including minorities).  

The principles enshrined by UDHR can be understood as follows:

1. All humans are born free and equal, with inherent dignity and should not suffer oppression or degradation on account of their differences among individuals in societies worldwide 
2. The rights established apply to all people without exception—including women (Article 2), which makes it particularly relevant for gender equality issues across the globe  
3. States are called upon not only to respect these standards but also actively ensure their implementation and uphold human dignity within its borders, as well as advocate at international levels against injustice wherever they may arise (Article 8)   
4. Finally, it is through this Declaration that individuals can hold governments accountable for the protection of these rights by petitioning internationally when their own domestic mechanisms fail to provide justice or remedy violations  
5. It encourages nations and societies worldwide toward peaceful coexistence built on respect, tolerance, equity—values that are inherent in human dignity (UDHR's preamble). 

In summary, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies to everyone – it is universally binding for all individuals without distinction and serves as a universal standard against which governments can be held accountable. It provides moral guidance on treating others with respect and dignity in their dealings at both national and international levels while advancing human rights, justice, equality before the law, non-discrimination principles worldwide ultimately serving to unite humankind across cultural divides for progressive betterment of societies.

She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role , from five nominations , and received a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992 . Hepburn received 10 Golden Globe Award nominations , winning two , and was the recipient of the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1990 . She also won the 1954 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play in Ondine , and received a Special Tony Award in 1968 . ;"Audrey Hepner never won a Tony Award. The confusion may arise because she was nominated, but that is as far as her involvement with the Tonys went. Audrey Hepburn gained fame and received numerous accolades in film acting rather than stage performances typically associated with Broadway's West Side Story where one might expect such nominations from this play led to an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress, not a Tony.

Audrey Hepner was most famously recognized as ""Scarlett O'Hara"" in the 1939 film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell’ extralusual novel 'Gone with The Wind.' In addition to her celebrated roles on screen, she received several honors for acting and charitable work. These include:
- An Honorary Oscar at age 65 years old (Oscar Juvenile Award) in recognition of lifetime achievement as a motion picture actress which was bestowed by the Academy Awards ceremony that took place in Hollywood rather than New York City, where Tony awards are given out annually for excellence on Broadway.
- An Honorary Oscar at age 72 years old (Oscar Dame) from The British Film Institute ""In Recognition of Her Outstanding Achievement as a Filmmaker"" which is another cinema award and not part of the Tony Awards ceremony in theatre.
  
She was indeed an exceptional actress, but her recognition came primarily through film rather than stage performances or Broadway plays like 'West Side Story.'

43;when did the word robotics first appear in print;" According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word robotics was first used in print by Isaac Asimov , in his science fiction short story `` Liar ! '' , published in May 1941 in Astounding Science Fiction . Asimov was unaware that he was coining the term ; since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics , he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots . In some of Asimov 's other works , he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story Runaround ( Astounding Science Fiction , March 1942 ) . However , the original publication of `` Liar ! '' predates that of `` Runaround '' by ten months , so the former is generally cited as the word 's origin . ";"The term ""robotics"" began to gain prominency after World War I, but it was not until much later that significant usage and formalization of the concept appeared. The origin can be traced back to a play on words by an author named Karel Čapek in his science fiction novel titled ""R.U.R."" (Rossum's Universal Robots), which translates from Czech as such.

""R.U.R.,"" published in 1920, was the first time that robots were used not just conceptually but also given a name and character within literature - ""robots,"" derived from ""roboty."" Čapek's vision of mechanical workers who eventually rebel against their human creators is often considered one of the seminal moments in robotics.

While it may be challenging to pinpoint specific instances where simply being told about or discussing these machines appeared, this novel undoubtedly marks a significant point when robots entered into print and became central figures within fiction—which has implications for how society views the field of artificial intelligence today.";160;9;138;22.654395818710327;14.834842105263153;96.6842105263158

46;where does publisher clearing house money come from; Publishers Clearing House ( PCH ) is a direct marketing company that markets merchandise and magazine subscriptions with sweepstakes , and prize - based games . ;"The Publishers Clearing House (PCH) is a direct marketing and promotional company that sends mail-order, online sweepstakes draws, gift cards, event tickets prizes to consumers. The revenue PCH generates comes primarily through these activities:

1. Sweepstakes Drawings: Participants enter the contest for a chance at large cash or prize values by purchasing entry forms from local businesses that partner with them (often referred to as ""sponsors""). Although entering is typically free, companies often subsidize this expense in exchange for advertising and potential sales through increased brand awareness.

2. Membership: Some people opt into a premium membership program which offers more exclusive deals or discounts on PCH products/services beyond the regular prize draw offerings (though it's essential to note that this does not guarantee entry). The fees collected from these memberships contribute significantly to their revenue.

3. Sales: Whenever a customer wins, they receive an invoice for goods or services valued at approximately $50 - upwards of hundreds and even thousands if the prize is substantial (like trips), which PCH then sells on behthyretc markets like Amazon to make profit margins after their expenses.

4. Partnerships: Local businesses, such as department stores or electronics vendors who enter into sponsorship deals with publishers clearinghouse contribute a portion of the proceeds from sales made through PCH promotional materials they distribute in exchange for advertising and market visibility benefits. 

5. Licensing: For some large scale events, like their annual Christmas campaign or back-to-school promotion, third parties may pay licensing fees to use the publisher clearinghouse brand name on promotional materials they distribute independently (like flyers). This creates another source of revenue for PCH.

It's worth noting that while these methods provide income, some consumers criticize sweepstakes and mail-order business models as being potentially misleading or predatory in nature due to their low perceived entry costs but high potential monetary losses (if they purchase merchandise). In many jurisdictions where consumer protection laws exist around these types of promotional activities, there are guidelines on how companies like PCH must operate and disclose information about participating in the sweepstakes.";342;8;26;51.62248611450195;14.823333333333327;97.28888888888889

49;ukraine starts liquidation of legendary aircraft manufacturer antonov; On 19 July 2017 , the Ukrainian government approved the liquidation of Antonov 's assets , starting with closing down three factories in Kiev and Kharkiv . The State Concern `` Antonov '' ( a business group , created in 2005 from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management ) will be liquidated as a residual corporate entity . Antonov State Company , Kharkiv State Aviation Manufacturing Enterprise and Plant No 410 of Civil Aviation were transferred under the management of another state - owned concern Ukroboronprom in 2015 . Antonov State Company continues to function as an enterprise . ;"The news about Ukraine initiating the process to dismantle or ""liquidate"" a historic aircraft manufacturing company, presumably Antonov Airlines if we are referring to Zaporozhye-based Antonov Aircraft Industries known for its wide range of military and civilian aviation products (though it's worth notimting that there is no specific well-known entity called ""Antonov Airlines""), can have significant implications both domestically within Ukraine and on the international stage. Here are some potential impact considerations:

1. **Economic Consequences**: The liquidation of a large industrial enterprise like Antonov could lead to substantial economic repercussions for those directly involved, including job losses which may further strain an already struggling economy amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia since 2014 and current events leading up to or following from early 2023.

2. **National Industry**: Antonov Aircraft is not just any company—it has a storied history as one of Ukraine's significant manufacturing entities, particularly known for its wide-body military transport aircraft like the An-124 Ruslan and others developed by Ilyushin design bureau before nationalization. The closure could represent an end to centuries of aviation industry heritage in Ukraine if it doesn’t find a new purpose or lease on life elsewhere, which might be seen as damaging both culturally and industrially for the country's reputation and industrial capabilities.

3. **Strategic Capabilities**: The Antonov aircraft range is often cited among some of the world's largest flying objects by wingspan they serve strategically in military logistics, humanitarian aid delivery (such as during natural disaster responses), or for transporting critical resources across great distances where other types might not be practical. Their absence could leave a gap that adversaries may seek to exploit but also highlight the vulnerabilities of supply chains dependent on such unique capabilities if they are integral, prompting international discourse and potential collaborative efforts among nations possessing similar or complementary assets for defense purposes.

4. **International Relations**: Depending on how it's perceived internationally—particularly by Western countries who may see this as a consequence of the war with Russia, which often provides financial assistance to Ukraine in various sectors (including military and aviation) —there could be political fallout or increased international scrutiny. It might also affect relationships within NATO if Antonov aircraft were being used for multinational missions under shared agreements.

5. **Technology Transfer**: The end of a manufacturing capability may impact the flow and transfer of technology associated with it, possibly limiting Ukraine's access to certain advanced technologies or making future partnerships more difficult as trust in Ukrainian enterprises might wane if they face uncertain futures due to conflict.

6. **Environmental Concern**: Depending on how liquidation is carried out and what will follow—either dismantling the aircraft for scrap, repurposing them (like converting military crafts into civilian ones), or other means of dealing with such industrial assets can raise environmental concerns regarding waste management.

7. **Cultural Heritage**: If Antonov Aircraft Industries were a symbolic site where significant technological and design advances took place, there would be cultural implications for the preservation versus modernization debate some may argue that these structures have historical value beyond their current operational use.

8. **Market Dynamics**: The loss of Antonov's large-scale manufacturing might open opportunities or challenges in regional aircraft markets, especially if they previously relied on the company for heavy transport capabilities and are now forced to seek alternatives which could disrupt existing supply chains that may not be readily upgrades.

9. **Global Supply Chain**: If Antonov were part of an international consortium or had contracts with foreign nations, liquidation would necessitate negotiations about these agreements and potentially affect other players in the global aviation industry who have a stake within this framework—whether as suppliers, competitors, customers, etc.

In reality, any specific news item on such an event should be closely analyzed with attention to detail provided by credible sources for accurate implications and consequences speculations without concrete information might not reflect the true impact of these changes in Ukraine's industrial landscape or international relations dynamics.";652;8;108;95.78454542160034;14.825682352941161;95.3529411764706
