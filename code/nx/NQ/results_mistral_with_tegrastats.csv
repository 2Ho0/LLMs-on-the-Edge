6;what type of reaction leads to the production of polymers; The condensation reaction is used to synthetically produce nylon polymers in industry . Nylons must specifically include an straight chain ( aliphatic ) monomer . The amide link is produced from an amine group ( alternatively known as an amino group ) , and a carboxylic acid group . The hydroxyl from the carboxylic acid combines with a hydrogen from the amine , and gives rise to water , the elimination byproduct that is the namesake of the reaction . ;" The type of reaction that leads to the production of polymers is polymerization. Polymerization is a process by which small molecules (monomers) join together in a repeated fashion to form large macromolecules, or polymers. There are two main types of polymerization reactions: addition polymerization and condensation polymerization.

1. Addition Polymerization: In this type of reaction, monomer molecules add to each other one at a time through covalent bonds, typically by repeating the same process, with new monomers adding at the end of the growing chain. Common examples include polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP).

2. Condensation Polymerization: In this type of reaction, monomer molecules join together through covalent bonds to form larger molecules, which then lose a small molecule (often water or alcohols), releasing it as a byproduct. Examples include nylon and polyester.";132;10;80;25.702746152877808;19.993681818181813;96.31818181818181
7;when did the one game wild card start; From 1969 through 1993 , division leaders in each league advanced to the League Championship Series , with the winners of each LCS meeting in the World Series . However , an expanding number of teams over the years made making the playoffs increasingly difficult .

In the new three - division leagues , each league had four teams in the playoffs . In addition to the three division winners , a wild - card team made the playoffs as the fourth seed . This was the team with the most wins amongst non-division winners . The wild - card matchup was played in the first round between the League leader in wins and the wild - card team , unless both teams were in the same division , which resulted in the wild card facing the second - best division winner in the league . ;" The one-game Wild Card playoff, also known as a Wild Card Game or a Play-In Game, was first introduced in the National Football League (NFL) in 1970. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the one-game Wild Card playoffs were implemented for the first time in the 1994 season. However, it should be noted that these playoffs did not occur due to a players' strike during that year.

13;how many pages are in the harry potter series; Jenny Sawyer wrote in Christian Science Monitor on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a `` disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society '' in that stories `` moral center ( sic ) have all but vanished from much of today 's pop culture ... after 10 years , 4,195 pages , and over 375 million copies , J.K. Rowling 's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children 's literature : the hero 's moral journey '' . Harry Potter , Sawyer argues , neither faces a `` moral struggle '' nor undergoes any ethical growth , and is thus `` no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white '' . In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry 's first passage through to Platform 93⁄4 as an application of faith and hope , and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes . She also noted the `` deeper magic '' by which the self - sacrifice of Harry 's mother protects the boy throughout the series , and which the power - hungry Voldemort fails to understand . ;" The Harry Potter series, written by J.K.

14;where is the lava stored in a volcano;" A magma chamber is a large pool of liquid rock beneath the surface of the Earth . The molten rock , or magma , in such a chamber is under great pressure , and , given enough time , that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it , creating a way for the magma to move upward . If it finds its way to the surface , then the result will be a volcanic eruption ; consequently , many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers . These chambers are hard to detect deep within the Earth , and therefore most of those known are close to the surface , commonly between 1 km and 10 km down . ";" Lava is not ""stored"" in a volcano in the way that water is stored in a tank. Instead, magma (which becomes lava upon eruption) is located beneath the Earth's surface within the volcano. This molten rock resides in magma chambers or magma storage areas that are formed by the movement of tectonic plates and the pressure exerted on them. These chambers can be found at various depths below the surface, with the average depth being between 5 to 10 kilometers (3.1 to 6.2 miles). When the pressure inside the magma chamber increases, or when the weakened crust over the chamber cannot contain it anymore, an eruption occurs, and the lava pours out from the volcano's summit or fissures on its sides.";121;8;119;22.173776865005493;20.03252631578947;97.15789473684211

Some took the offer , such as Teófilo Marxuach , a former Lieutenant in the Spanish Army who joined the regiment , and others , such as Capt . Angel Rivero Méndez , declined the offer and retired from the military . ; The American occupation of Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War was not a military campaign led by an individual, but rather a result of the Treaty of Paris (1898), which ended the Spanish-American War. In this treaty, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States. The U.S. Navy played a significant role in the capture of Puerto Rico from the Spanish forces, and Admiral William T. Sampson was one of the key naval commanders during the battle. However, the American occupation and governance of Puerto Rico that followed was administered by the United States Government as a whole, not an individual.;105;12;204;17.04635214805603;19.999785714285718;94.71428571428571

19;when did they stop using knob and tube wiring in homes; Knob - and - tube wiring ( sometimes abbreviated K&T ) is an early standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings , in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s . It consisted of single - insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities , passing through joist and stud drill - holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes , and supported along their length on nailed - down porcelain knob insulators . Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch , or were pulled into a wall , they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom . The first insulation was asphalt - saturated cotton cloth , then rubber became common . Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength , then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape ( asphalt saturated cloth ) , or made inside metal junction boxes . ;" Knob and tube (K&T) wiring, which consists of individual wires that run through hollow tubes or ""knobs"" spaced along the surface of framing members, was a common method used for electrical wiring in homes from the late 1800s to the mid-1900s. The use of knob and tube wiring began to decline after World War II with the introduction of newer, more efficient wiring methods such as non-metallic sheathed (Romex) cable.

In the United States, the National Electrical Code (NEC), which sets the standard for safe electrical installations, officially stopped allowing new residential installations using knob and tube wiring in 1954. However, it is important to note that many homes built before this date may still have some knob and tube wiring present within their electrical systems.

If you are considering buying a home built prior to 1954, it's essential to have the electrical system inspected by a licensed electrician to ensure it is safe and up to code. Older electrical systems can pose fire risks if they have become damaged or deteriorated over time.";174;11;160;30.643256187438965;20.00434615384615;95.11538461538461
20;when did they stop hanging in the us; Hanging has been practiced legally in the United States of America from the nation 's birth , up to 1972 when the United States Supreme Court found capital punishment to be in violation of the eighth amendment to the United States Constitution . Four years later , the Supreme Court overturned its previous ruling , and in 1976 , capital punishment was again legalized in the United States . Hanging has returned to the states of Washington and New Hampshire . ; The practice of public hangings as a form of capital punishment was officially abolished in the United States. It was largely phased out between the 1930s and 1960s. In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the application of the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in the case of Furman v. Georgia. This ruling led to a moratorium on capital punishment in the United States. The practice was reinstated in 1976 with the passage of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Gregg v. Georgia, which established guidelines for the application of the death penalty that were less arbitrary and more consistent with the Eighth Amendment. Since then, there have been no public hangings as a form of capital punishment in the United States.;130;8;81;22.490933895111084;20.001368421052625;95.73684210526316

22;what is the purpose of constructing a calibration curve;" In analytical chemistry , a calibration curve , also known as a standard curve , is a general method for determining the concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparing the unknown to a set of standard samples of known concentration . A calibration curve is one approach to the problem of instrument calibration ; other standard approaches may mix the standard into the unknown , giving an internal standard . ";" A calibration curve, also known as a standard curve or calibration graph, is used to determine the concentration or quantity of an analyte (a substance being measured) in a sample based on its response or signal. It is constructed by plotting the known concentrations or amounts of the analyte against their corresponding responses.

Here are some purposes of constructing a calibration curve:

1. Quantification: To quantify the concentration or amount of an analyte in a sample, you can measure its response and find it on the calibration curve. The point where the sample's response intersects with the calibration curve will give the concentration or quantity of the analyte.

2. Validation: A well-established calibration curve helps to validate the accuracy and reliability of your measurement equipment or method. By comparing the measured responses of known concentrations or amounts to the expected values, you can assess the precision and linearity of your results.

3. Standardization: Calibration curves are essential for standardizing analytical instruments, ensuring they produce consistent and accurate results over time. This is especially important in fields such as chemistry, biology, pharmaceuticals, and environmental science.

4. Quality control: Calibration curves help in maintaining the quality of measurement results by allowing researchers or analysts to periodically verify the performance of their instruments and check for any potential drift or inconsistencies in measurements.

5. Troubleshooting: If your instrument starts producing unexpected or inconsistent results, comparing them to a calibration curve can help you diagnose issues with the equipment or identify problems with your measurement procedure.";252;9;73;41.237836599349976;20.033861111111108;96.08333333333333

24;where is the silk road located on a map; The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction originally through regions of Eurasia connecting the East and West and stretching from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean Sea . The Silk Road concept refers to both the terrestrial and the maritime routes connecting Asia and Europe . The overland Steppe route stretching through the Eurasian steppe is considered the ancestor to the Silk Road ( s ) . ;" The Silk Road was not a single, fixed route but a network of trade routes that connected the East and West from the 2nd century BCE to the 18th century CE. It extended from the Korean peninsula and Japan to the Mediterranean sea, passing through China (including Central Asia), India, Persia, Arabia, and Europe. Here is a simplified map representation of its general route:

On this map, notice that the Silk Road did not follow a direct line but rather branched out across continents, connecting various civilizations along the way. It was primarily used for the exchange of goods such as silk, spices, precious metals, and ideas (such as religion, technology, art, and culture). The Silk Road played a significant role in the development of the East Asian, Southeast Asian, Indian subcontinent, Persian, Hellenistic Greek world, Byzantine Empire, European Middle Ages, and Islamic Golden Age.";145;9;83;24.633065700531006;20.003238095238093;94.14285714285714

26;what's the difference between tweedle dee and tweedle dum; Tweedledum and Tweedledee are fictional characters in an English nursery rhyme and in Lewis Carroll 's Through the Looking - Glass , and What Alice Found There . Their names may have originally come from an epigram written by poet John Byrom . The nursery rhyme has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19800 . The names have since become synonymous in western popular culture slang for any two people who look and act in identical ways , generally in a derogatory context . ;" Tweedledee and Tweedledum are fictional characters from Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" a novel considered to be a sequel to ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" They are identical in most ways, with the exception that their personalities differ slightly.

Tweedledee tends to speak first and more often, while Tweedledum is usually quieter and lets Tweedledee do most of the talking. However, they both share a habit of using paradoxical statements and riddles. Their names are a play on the words ""tweedledee"" (a nonsense word meaning ""very similar"") and ""tweedledum"" (another nonsense word with a similar meaning).

In essence, although they appear identical, their personalities show a subtle difference: Tweedledee is more vocal, while Tweedledum tends to be quieter. This slight characterization helps them maintain their individuality despite their physical similarity.";129;9;85;26.63682723045349;20.031217391304345;97.08695652173913
27;what do the lyrics mean to lady marmalade; Labelle 's version of `` Lady Marmalade '' was produced by Allen Toussaint and Vicki Wickham . It was released in November 1974 from Nightbirds , their first album after signing with Epic Records . Patti LaBelle sang lead vocals on `` Lady Marmalade '' with backing vocals being contributed by bandmates Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash . The song is best known for the French lyric `` Voulez - vous coucher avec moi ce soir ? '' ( English : `` Would you like to sleep with me tonight ? '' ) in the refrain . `` Lady Marmalade '' is a song about a prostitute , although Patti LaBelle , the lead female vocal of the band , was completely oblivious to its overall message , saying : `` I did n't know what it was about . I do n't know French and nobody , I swear this is God 's truth , nobody at all told me what I 'd just sung a song about . '' ;" ""Lady Marmalade"" is a song by the group Patti LaBelle and her New Band, later joined by Labelle, released in 1974. The song's most famous version was recorded by Christina Aguilera, Pink, Lil' Kim, Mýa, and Missy Elliott in 2001 as a remake for the film ""Moulin Rouge!""

The lyrics tell a story of a seductive courtesan named Delilah, who works at the Moulin Rouge, a famous cabaret in Paris. The title ""Lady Marmalade"" is mentioned several times and seems to be another name for Delilah. Here's a breakdown of some key lyrics and their possible meanings:

1. ""Voulez-vous coucher dès maintenant avec moi, dans ma chambre?"" – This French phrase translates to ""Do you want to sleep with me tonight in my room?"" Delilah is inviting her lover to spend the night with her.

2. ""C'est moi l'qui fait le feu qui brûle"" – Translated as ""I am the one who makes the fire that burns."" Delilade takes responsibility for being passionate and intense in a relationship.

3. ""Tu veux, tu veux, tu veux coucher avec moi, secrètement, comme nous avons toujours fait"" – Translated as ""You want, you want, you want to sleep with me secretly, like we've always done."" Delilade is suggesting that her lover has always wanted to sleep with her and implies a long-standing affair.

4. ""Moi, oh, Moi, oh, Lady Marmalade"" – The chorus repeats the phrase, referring to Delilah as ""Lady Marmalade,"" indicating her status as a courtesan at the Moulin Rouge.

5. ""I'm your fantasy, I'll make you see what you've never seen before"" – Delilade promises to provide an extraordinary and unforgettable experience for her lover.

The song is a sensual and provocative exploration of passion, desire, and the allure of the courtesans in the Moulin Rouge. The lyrics emphasize the mysterious and captivating nature of these women, who use their charm to entice men and maintain their lifestyle.";318;8;171;64.07908272743225;20.024124999999998;96.25

31;when can a writ of mandamus be issued; Mandamus ( `` We command '' ) is a judicial remedy in the form of an order from a superior court , to any government subordinate court , corporation , or public authority , to do ( or forbear from doing ) some specific act which that body is obliged under law to do ( or refrain from doing ) , and which is in the nature of public duty , and in certain cases one of a statutory duty . It can not be issued to compel an authority to do something against statutory provision . For example , it can not be used to force a lower court to reject or authorize applications that have been made , but if the court refuses to rule one way or the other then a mandamus can be used to order the court to rule on the applications . ;" A Writ of Mandamus is a judicial order compelling an official or public body to perform a duty that they are obligated to do but have failed to do. It can be issued under certain circumstances in various legal systems, typically when there has been a clear legal right to the action that is being withheld and the writ serves the interests of justice. Here are some general conditions for issuing a Writ of Mandamus:

1. The right to the performance of the act is clear and unmistakable in law
2. There is no discretion left to the officer or body on whom the duty is imposed, as the power conferred upon them is a mere ministerial one
3. Refusal or failure to perform the act results in a legal wrong and
4. The writ serves the interests of justice and there is no other adequate remedy available.

In the United States, for example, a Writ of Mandamus can be issued by a federal court under 28 U.S.C. §1361, which provides that a court may issue such a writ ""to any Court appointed under Article III or to any person"" if it appears that the person has ""unlawfully failed or refused to perform"" a duty owed to a claimant under the United States or under any Act of Congress.

32;what is an honorable discharge from the marines; To receive an honorable discharge , a service member must have received a rating from good to excellent for his or her service . Service members who meet or exceed the required standards of duty performance and personal conduct , and who complete their tours of duty , normally receive honorable discharges . However , one need not complete a term of service to receive an honorable discharge , provided the reason for involuntary discharge is not due to misconduct . For instance , service members rendered physically or psychologically incapable of performing assigned duties normally have their service characterized as honorable , regardless of whether they incurred the condition or disability in the line of duty , provided they otherwise met or exceeded standards . Similarly , service members selected for involuntary discharge due to a Reduction in Force ( RIF ) typically receive an honorable discharge , assuming their conduct while on active duty met or exceeded standards . ; An Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps is a type of administrative separation that signifies a marine has served with distinction, met all military obligations, and conducted themselves in a manner consistent with the standards and values of the corps. It's the highest form of discharge a service member can receive, indicating they have no dishonorable characteristics that would make them unfit for service in any capacity.

33;when did the first us state legalize weed; The legal history of cannabis in the United States began with state - level prohibition in the early 20th century , with the first major federal limitations occurring in 1937 . Starting with Oregon in 1973 , individual states began to liberalize cannabis laws through decriminalization . In 1996 , California became the first state to legalize medical cannabis , sparking a trend that spread to a majority of states by 2016 . In 2012 , Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize cannabis for recreational use . ; The first U.S. state to legalize recreational marijuana was Colorado, on January 1, 2014. Washington State followed suit later that same day. Both states had passed ballot initiatives in November 2012 to legalize recreational cannabis. Since then, several other states and the District of Columbia have also legalized recreational marijuana. It's important to note that while recreational use is allowed in these jurisdictions, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.;69;8;90;13.495916366577148;19.945636363636364;97.27272727272727
34;where did the settlers of new hampshire come from;" Massachusetts was first colonized by principally English Europeans in the early 17th century , and became the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the 18th century . Prior to English colonization of the area , it was inhabited by a variety of mainly Algonquian language indigenous tribes . The first permanent English settlement in New England came in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth Colony by the Pilgrims who sailed on the Mayflower . It set precedents but never grew large . A large - scale Puritan migration began in 1630 with the establishment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony , and spawned the settlement of other New England colonies . Friction with the natives erupted in the high - casualty King Philip 's War in the 1670s . Puritanism was the established religion and was strictly enforced ; dissenters were exiled . The Colony clashed with Anglican opponents in England over its religious intolerance and the status of its charter . Most people were farmers . Businessmen established wide - ranging trade links , sending ships to the West Indies and Europe , and sometimes shipping goods in violation of the Navigation Acts . These political and trade issues led to the revocation of the Massachusetts charter in 1684 . ";" The initial settlers of New Hampshire came primarily from England, especially from the counties of Devon, Dorset, and Essex. Many were Puritans seeking religious freedom, as well as farmers, artisans, and merchants who wanted to establish new communities in America.

The first recorded settlement in New Hampshire was at the Piscataqua River by Simon Adair and John Mason in 1623, which later became Portsmouth, but the permanent settlement occurred in 1630 with the founding of Dover. The Massachusetts Bay Colony initially claimed jurisdiction over New Hampshire until it was granted a royal charter as a separate province in 1679, under the name Province of New England in Charater of William and Mary.

Additional waves of settlers came from other parts of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany during the 18th century. The Great Migration between 1630 and 1640 brought many more Puritans to New Hampshire, while later migrations included French Canadians in the late 1700s and Irish and German immigrants in the 19th century.";163;9;208;29.499057054519653;20.01215999999999;98.08

36;the three pillars of the westphalian constitution of world politics are; Westphalian sovereignty , or state sovereignty , is the principle of international law that each nation - state has exclusive sovereignty over its territory . External powers should not interfere in another country 's domestic affairs . Each state , no matter how large or small , has equal rights to sovereignty . The principle underlies the modern international system of sovereign states . The United Nations Charter states that `` nothing should authorise intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state . '' ;"1. Westphalian Sovereignty: This principle asserts that each state has exclusive authority over its territory and domestic matters, free from external interference. It is derived from the Peace of Westphalia treaties that ended the Thirty Years' War in Europe during the 17th century.

2. Non-Intervention: This principle holds that states should refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other nations unless explicitly invited to do so. It is closely related to sovereignty, as it acknowledges that each state has the right to govern itself without external interference.

3. Recognition: The recognition principle dictates that other states must acknowledge and respect the territorial integrity, independence, and legitimate government of a recognized state. This means that only recognized states can participate in international relations and be considered as equal members of the global community.";133;11;87;22.408960342407227;20.041421052631573;94.78947368421052
37;what type of genetic mutation is huntington's disease;" HD is typically inherited from a person 's parents , although up to 10 % of cases are due to a new mutation . The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual 's two copies of a gene called Huntingtin . This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50 % chance of inheriting the disease . The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called `` huntingtin '' . Expansion of CAG ( cytosine - adenine - guanine ) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein , which gradually damages cells in the brain , through mechanisms that are not fully understood . Diagnosis is by genetic testing , which can be carried out at any time , regardless of whether or not symptoms are present . This fact raises several ethical debates : the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing ; whether parents have the right to have their children tested ; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results . ";" Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a specific type of genetic mutation known as an expanded trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene. More specifically, it involves a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in exon 1 of the HTT gene on chromosome 4.

The normal number of repeats for this region is between 9 and 35. People with more than 35 repeats may carry the HD mutation, and the number of repeats is inversely correlated with age at onset and disease severity. This type of mutation is classified as a trinucleotide repeat expansion (TRE) disorder.

In Huntington's disease, the expanded CAG repeat leads to an abnormal form of the huntingtin protein that contains an extended polyglutamine tract. This misfolded protein forms aggregates in affected cells and neurons, leading to progressive cell death and symptoms associated with HD.";135;8;191;25.81554341316223;20.02863636363636;94.81818181818181

4. Lastly, it could simply be a fictional character created by someone for their own amusement or for a story they wrote. Without more context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact origin of ""Spotty Muldoon.""";152;8;22;29.72823977470398;20.060479999999995;96.12
