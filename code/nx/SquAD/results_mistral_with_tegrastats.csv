6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;" The prime number theorem, first stated by Johann Lambert in 1760 and later proved independently by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, is a fundamental result in number theory. It states that the distribution of prime numbers among the positive integers follows an exponential rate, specifically:

As n approaches infinity, the number of primes less than or equal to n is approximately n / ln(n).

In other words, the prime number theorem gives an estimate for the density of prime numbers among the natural numbers. It's a cornerstone result in analytic number theory and has far-reaching implications in areas such as cryptography and computer science.";103;11;5;22.82491660118103;21.38568421052631;97.36842105263158

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;" Imperialism is typically administered through colonization, or the establishment and maintenance of control over a territory and its people by a more powerful country. This involves several key mechanisms:

1. Direct rule (or colonial administration): The conquering power governs the colony directly through appointed officials, imposing its own laws, policies, and institutions upon the native population.
2. Indirect rule: The conquering power maintains its control by working through established local leaders or traditional institutions, using these leaders as intermediaries to exert influence over the colony.
3. Protectorates and mandates: In this arrangement, a foreign power is granted authority over a territory but does not fully annex it, instead acting as a protector or trustee responsible for the well-being of the native population.
4. Economic domination: Imperial powers may control colonies through economic means, such as extracting resources, imposing trade agreements, and establishing monopolies. This often involves creating infrastructure like railways, ports, and telecommunication networks to facilitate exploitation.
5. Cultural imperialism: Through the spread of language, religion, customs, and ideas, imperial powers attempt to reshape the culture of their colonies in their own image, with the goal of making them more manageable and subservient.
6. Military occupation: Imperial powers maintain control through military force, often using troops to quell rebellions, suppress dissent, or defend against external threats.
7. Diplomatic maneuvering: Imperial powers also engage in diplomacy with neighboring countries and indigenous groups, seeking alliances, treaties, and strategic partnerships that further their interests and maintain their dominance.
8. Economic incentives and sanctions: Offering economic rewards or imposing penalties can be an effective means of controlling colonies, as these can motivate local leaders to cooperate with the imperial power and help maintain order in the colony.
9. Education and propaganda: Imperial powers often invest in education systems and media outlets within their colonies to shape public opinion, instill loyalty to the imperial power, and promote a positive image of the colonizer's culture and values.
10. Bribery and corruption: By providing financial incentives or opportunities for personal gain, imperial powers can influence local leaders and elites, encouraging them to collaborate with the imperial power and undermine the interests of their own people.

Overall, imperialism is a complex process that relies on multiple strategies and mechanisms to establish, maintain, and extend control over colonized territories and peoples.";382;7;8;86.4740138053894;21.316181818181814;96.83116883116882
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;" Improving upon Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion didn't occur as a single event but rather through the accumulation of insights and discoveries by subsequent scientists. Here are some key milestones:

1. In 1744, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis proposed the principle of least action (also known as Maupertuis's law), which is closely related to Newton's second law of motion.

2. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, James Clerk Maxwell developed classical electrodynamics by mathematically describing electromagnetic fields and their interactions with charges, expanding upon the electrical and magnetic components of Newton's laws of motion.

3. Albert Einstein revolutionized physics in 1905 with his special theory of relativity. This modified Newton's laws of motion for high velocities (approaching the speed of light) by showing that mass and energy are interchangeable, leading to the famous equation E=mc², thus providing a more accurate description of motion under extreme conditions.

4. In 1915, Einstein published his general theory of relativity, which expanded upon gravity and Newton's law of universal gravitation by introducing the concept that massive objects cause distortions in space-time, leading to a more accurate explanation for the behavior of celestial bodies.

5. In the 20th century, quantum mechanics was developed by scientists like Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrödinger, which provided a framework for understanding the behavior of very small particles (atoms and subatomic particles) that cannot be explained using Newtonian mechanics alone.

6. In the 21st century, modern physics continues to build upon these foundations, with ongoing developments in areas like string theory, quantum gravity, and cosmology that strive for a unified theory of everything.

In summary, while Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion have been essential in our understanding of the physical world, they have also been refined and expanded over time by many brilliant scientists who built upon his work.";304;14;4;73.10555744171143;21.29850769230768;97.3076923076923
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"1. Politics: One of the primary aims of Islamism is to establish a political system that is based on Islamic law (Shariah). This can range from advocating for the implementation of Shariah principles within existing democratic frameworks, to seeking the establishment of an Islamic state (Caliphate) with a comprehensive set of rules and regulations derived from Shariah.

2. Society: Islamism encourages the integration of Islamic values into all aspects of society, including family life, education, economy, and culture. This can include promoting Islamic moral values, encouraging modesty in dress and behavior, advocating for the protection of Muslim communities, and working towards social justice and equity within society.

3. Economy: Many Islamist movements advocate for an economic system that is just and equitable, often drawing inspiration from principles found in the Quran and Sunnah. This can include advocating for the elimination of interest (Riba), encouraging charitable giving (Zakat), and promoting fair trade practices.

4. International Relations: Islamism often emphasizes the need to uphold Islamic values in international relations, including respecting the sovereignty of Muslim nations, supporting oppressed Muslims around the world, and working towards peace and cooperation among Muslim countries.

5. Individual Conduct: Islamism encourages individuals to lead a life that is pleasing to God according to Islamic teachings. This can include encouraging regular prayer (Salah), fasting during Ramadan, giving Zakat, and abstaining from haram (forbidden) activities like gambling, consumption of alcohol, and illicit sexual relations.

6. Education: Islamism advocates for education that instills Islamic values, fosters a deep understanding of the Quran and Sunnah, and equips individuals with the knowledge to lead a virtuous life. This can include promoting Islamic schools or incorporating Islamic studies into mainstream education systems.

7. Legal System: Islamism seeks to replace secular legal systems with one based on Shariah law, which it believes provides a just and equitable framework for society. This can include the application of punishments like the Hadud (physical punishments for certain crimes), Qisas (retribution for murder), and Diyah (compensation for harm caused).

8. Media and Communication: Islamism often seeks to influence media and communication platforms to promote Islamic values, discourage immoral content, and counter negative portrayals of Islam and Muslims. This can include establishing Islamic television channels, radio stations, or news agencies.

9. Development and Welfare: Islamist movements often focus on social welfare and development projects aimed at improving the quality of life for Muslim communities. This can include building mosques, providing healthcare services, setting up educational institutions, and implementing poverty alleviation programs.

10. Culture and Arts: Islamism encourages the creation of Islamic art, literature, music, and other cultural expressions that reflect Islamic values and beliefs. This can include promoting calligraphy, Islamic architecture, Quran recitation, and Islamic philosophy.";447;11;4;104.66648149490356;21.333053763440866;96.44086021505376

21;The immune system protects organisms against what?;disease;"1. Pathogens: The immune system helps to protect the body from harmful bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms that can cause disease.

2. Foreign substances (antigens): The immune system identifies and eliminates foreign substances such as pollen, dust mites, and chemicals that may cause allergies or other adverse reactions in the body.

3. Cancer cells: In addition to fighting off external threats, the immune system also plays a crucial role in identifying and destroying abnormal cells that could potentially develop into cancer.

4. Toxins: The immune system helps neutralize and remove toxins produced by harmful microorganisms or those that enter the body through various means.

5. Infected or damaged tissue: In cases of injury or infection, the immune system works to clean up debris, repair damaged tissue, and prevent further damage or invasion by foreign substances.

6. Virus-infected cells: The immune system can recognize infected cells and either eliminate them directly (cell-mediated immunity) or produce antibodies to neutralize viruses that have escaped the cell (humoral immunity).

7. Microorganisms in food: The immune system helps defend against microorganisms that might be ingested with food, ensuring that they do not cause harm to the body.

8. Transplanted organs or tissues: In cases where a person receives a transplanted organ or tissue, the immune system can recognize this as foreign and mount an attack to reject it unless specific measures are taken to suppress the immune response.";234;7;1;53.76368522644043;21.402000000000008;97.46808510638297
22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;" To provide an accurate answer, I would need more specific data. The term ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" is not a standard term in economics or wealth distribution studies.

A notable example is the Civil Rights Movement in the United States led by Martin Luther King Jr.;82;15;2;16.691524744033813;21.454785714285716;89.42857142857143
26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;" Primary law refers to the foundational legal rules and principles that serve as a basis for subsequent laws, regulations, and interpretations. There are typically three main sources of primary law:

1. Constitutions: These are fundamental charters that establish the structure, powers, and limits of governmental authority in a given jurisdiction. Constitutional provisions may outline the rights and duties of citizens, as well as the procedures for amending the constitution itself.

2. Statutes (or Acts): These are written laws enacted by legislative bodies within a given jurisdiction. They typically address specific issues or areas of law, such as criminal law, civil law, administrative law, and procedural law. Statutes may be created through various legislative processes, including drafting, debate, voting, and promulgation.

3. Case Law (or Precedent): This refers to the legal principles developed by courts in the course of deciding specific cases. By analyzing the facts of a case, applying relevant laws and previous decisions, and issuing a ruling or judgment, courts establish case law that can provide guidance for future cases with similar facts or issues.

In addition to these primary sources, customary international law may also be considered a source of primary law in some contexts, particularly in the realm of international relations. Customary international law arises from widespread and consistent state practice that is generally recognized as legally binding by the international community of states.";227;8;5;47.64879512786865;21.393761904761917;95.38095238095238

37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;" The word ""imperialism"" is derived from the Latin term ""imperium,"" which means power or authority. This Latin term itself is derived from the verb ""imperare,"" meaning to command, enjoin, order, or to rule over. In Roman times, ""imperium"" referred to the highest form of power, usually held by the Emperor and high-ranking military officers. The concept was later adopted and transformed into the practice of imperialism as we understand it today in the context of European colonial expansion during the 19th and early 20th centuries.";85;10;1;18.973992586135864;21.358999999999998;93.25
38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by two United Nations organizations: the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988.

41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens; The agents that the immune system detects and responds to are called Antigens. These antigens can be viruses, bacteria, fungi, toxins, or even abnormal cells in our own bodies. The immune system has specific receptors for these antigens which help it recognize them as foreign and initiate an appropriate response.;50;10;1;12.239758253097534;21.2042;92.1
42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;" European Union (EU) law, also known as Union law or Community law, is a unique system of laws which binds together the Member States of the European Union. It consists of a set of rules that member countries have agreed to apply within their borders.

The primary sources of EU law are:

1. The Treaties: These are the founding documents of the EU, including the Treaty on the European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). They establish the EU's institutions, objectives, and policies.

2. Regulations: These are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all member states without any implementing legislation needed at the national level.

3. Directives: These require each member state to achieve a particular goal within a specified timeframe, but they leave it up to individual countries to decide how to implement the directive's requirements.

4. Decisions: These are legally binding for the parties to whom they are addressed. Unlike regulations and directives, decisions can be individually tailored to specific situations or entities.

5. Case law: The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) plays a crucial role in interpreting EU law. Its judgments can have significant impacts on member states' laws and practices.

6. Other forms of secondary legislation, such as recommendations, opinions, and resolutions. These are not legally binding but provide guidance or make recommendations to the member states or other institutions.

EU law is significant because it provides a legal framework that ensures the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EU, promotes human rights, environmental protection, consumer protection, and more. It also fosters economic integration and political cooperation among its members.";280;5;26;60.21915578842163;21.334584905660385;96.71698113207547
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;" In antiquity, the concept used by philosophers and scientists to study simple machines was known as ""Mechanical Philosophy"" or ""Physics"". This branch of philosophy focused on understanding the properties, behavior, and motion of objects. Within this field, they studied devices we now recognize as simple machines such as levers, pulleys, wedges, screws, and incline planes.

The most well-known ancient philosopher who made significant contributions to this area is Archimedes. His work, ""On the Equilibrium of Planes"", provides a detailed study of lever systems, including the principle that bears his name: ""Give me a place to stand, and I will move the earth.""

Another influential figure was Hero of Alexandria, who created numerous automata and devices using simple machines. He wrote several treatises on these topics, including ""Pneumatics,"" which describes various machines utilizing air pressure.

These philosophers laid the foundations for our modern understanding of mechanics, providing insights that would later be developed further during the Renaissance and beyond.";158;11;4;35.52608275413513;21.472290322580655;97.41935483870968
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"1. Autonomy in Curriculum and Pedagogy: Private schools often have more autonomy over their curriculum, teaching methods, and classroom environment compared to public schools. They can customize their educational approach according to the needs and preferences of students, families, and educators within the school community.

2. Tuition Fees: Private schools charge tuition fees, allowing them to generate revenue from student enrollment, which can be used to fund additional resources, smaller class sizes, specialized programs, or extracurricular activities that may not be available in public schools due to funding constraints.

3. Selective Admission: Private schools have the right to select their students based on various criteria such as academic ability, talent, or shared values, while public schools are obligated to serve all students within their district without discrimination. This can lead to a more homogenous student body in private schools, which may be an advantage for some families who seek a specific educational experience for their children.

4. Donations and Fundraising: Private schools can solicit donations from alumni, parents, businesses, or foundations to support their programs and facilities. Public schools receive funding primarily from local, state, and federal sources, which may limit the resources available for certain initiatives.

5. Flexibility in Calendar and Schedule: Some private schools offer a more flexible schedule or calendar than public schools, such as year-round schooling or shorter days during the summer months, allowing for more time off or focused learning periods.

6. Specialization: Private schools can specialize in areas not typically offered in public schools, such as arts, sciences, sports, languages, or religious education, catering to families who are interested in these specific focus areas.";270;10;4;57.820910930633545;21.371117647058835;96.41176470588235

46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters; Ctenophora, also known as Comb Jellies, are marine organisms and they primarily inhabit the world's oceans. They can be found in a wide variety of deep and shallow ocean habitats, including coral reefs and the open sea. However, a few freshwater species have been discovered. The majority of ctenophores live at depths between 200-4,000 feet (61-1,220 meters), where they are seldom seen by humans due to the difficulty in exploring these deep waters.;73;4;2;19.129697561264038;21.509;91.5
47;In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?;Brazil; The majority of the Amazon Rainforest is located in South America, primarily within Brazil.

Other countries sharing parts of the Amazon Rainforest include Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas department of France).;68;11;1;17.07438564300537;21.432428571428574;95.07142857142857
48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;" The European Union (EU) has a bicameral legislative system, consisting of two main institutions:

1. The European Parliament (EP): It is the directly elected body of the EU, representing the citizens of its member states. The EP has 705 members who are elected every five years by the citizens of the EU member states. It plays a crucial role in passing laws and has the power to approve or reject legislation proposed by the European Commission.

2. The Council of the European Union (often referred to as the ""Council of Ministers"" or simply ""the Council""): It is comprised of government representatives from each EU member state, usually ministers with responsibility in the area where legislation pertains. The Council has the power to adopt legally binding legislative acts jointly with the European Parliament.

These two bodies work together to propose, discuss, and pass laws within the framework of the EU's decision-making process. The European Commission is another essential institution that initiates policy proposals in the EU but does not have a formal role in the legislature.";175;12;9;35.952762603759766;21.45929032258065;97.7741935483871
