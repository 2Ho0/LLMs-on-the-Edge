3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava);"An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from **magma** (molten rock) or **lava**. When magma cools and solidifies, it forms igneous rocks with crystals that are visible to the naked eye. If the cooling process occurs quickly, the rock will have small crystals and be called a basalt or an andesite. However, if the cooling process is slow, the rock will form larger crystals and be referred to as granite.

So, to summarize: igneous rocks are formed from molten magma or lava that cools and solidifies into a crystalline structure!";91;10;7;26.235727548599243;20.8335;92.31818181818181

6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;"The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic (FTA) is a fundamental concept that defines the main role of prime numbers in number theory. It states:

**Every positive integer can be represented as a product of prime powers in a unique way, except for the order in which the prime factors are listed.**

In other words, every positive integer n can be written as:

n = p1^a1 × p2^a2 × ... × pn^an

where p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct prime numbers and a1, a2, ..., an are non-negative integers.

This theorem has far-reaching implications in number theory, including the concept of unique factorization, which is essential for many areas of mathematics. It shows that prime numbers play a central role in understanding the structure of positive integers.

So, there you have it! The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is often considered the most important theorem in number theory, and it's a fundamental tool for many mathematical applications.";154;11;5;41.513195276260376;20.973583333333337;88.22222222222223

12;What percentage of global assets does the richest 1% of people have?;40%;"According to a report by Oxfam, in 2020, the world's richest 1% held more than twice as much wealth as the rest of humanity combined. Specifically:

* The top 1% held 46% of global assets.
* The next 9% (up to the top 10%) held 39% of global assets.
* This means that just over half (85%) of global assets were held by the top 10%.
* Meanwhile, the remaining 90% of the population (the bottom 90%) held a mere 15% of global assets.

This is often referred to as the ""wealth gap"" or ""income inequality"". These numbers are based on data from Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report and are adjusted for inflation.

It's worth noting that these figures have been increasing over time, with some estimates suggesting that by 2025, the top 1% will hold more than two-thirds of global wealth.";142;12;1;41.00684356689453;21.02202777777778;95.22222222222223
13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France;"France's Huguenot (French Calvinist) population was largely centered in the southwestern region of France, particularly in the provinces of Guyenne, Gascony, and Languedoc. These regions were home to many Calvinist communities and cities, such as:

1. La Rochelle: A major Huguenot stronghold on the Atlantic coast.
2. Bordeaux: The capital of Guyenne, which was a hub of Huguenot influence in southwestern France.
3. Montauban: A city in the Tarn-et-Garonne department that was heavily influenced by Calvinism.
4. Nîmes: A city in Languedoc (now Occitanie) that had a significant Huguenot population.
5. the Cévennes Mountains: This mountain range in southern France was home to many Huguenots who fled persecution and established secret communities.

These regions were more tolerant of Protestantism due to their historical ties with England and the influence of Calvinist ideas, which spread through trade and cultural exchange. However, during the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598), these areas became centers of conflict between Catholics and Huguenots, leading to significant persecution and violence.

The Edict of Nantes in 1598 granted toleration to Huguenots in France, but it was revoked in 1685 by Louis XIV, leading to a mass exodus of Huguenots from these regions. Many settled in England, the Netherlands, or other Protestant countries, while others established new communities in the Americas.";212;7;7;67.32380032539368;20.88603389830508;93.9322033898305
14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;"Ctenophora, also known as the ""comb jellies,"" are a group of marine animals that belong to the phylum Ctenophora. They are simple, multicellular organisms that are related to sponges and cnidarians (such as jellyfish and corals), but are actually more closely related to bilaterians (animals with bilateral body symmetry).

Here are some key characteristics of ctenophores:

1. **Body structure**: Ctenophores have a gelatinous, umbrella-shaped body, typically with eight tentacles that resemble a comb or net.
2. **Movement**: They move using their numerous, hair-like appendages called cilia, which wave back and forth to propel the animal through the water.
3. **Nerve cells**: Ctenophores have nerve nets, but they lack a centralized brain or nervous system like more complex animals do.
4. **Feeding behavior**: Many species of ctenophores capture small prey using their tentacles and then digest it externally.
5. **Bioluminescence**: Some ctenophores are bioluminescent, meaning they can produce light through chemical reactions within their bodies.

Despite being simple organisms, ctenophores play an important role in the marine ecosystem as both predators and prey for other animals. They also provide a fascinating example of evolutionary convergence, where different body plans have evolved to perform similar functions in various environments.";197;4;8;61.13390064239502;20.890222222222228;97.03703703703704

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;"Imperialism has been administered in various ways throughout history, but some common means include:

1.  **Colonial Administration**: The colonial power directly administers the colonies or territories it has acquired through military conquest, treaty, or other means.
2.  **Indirect Rule**: In this system, a local ruler or nobility is allowed to maintain control over their territory in exchange for loyalty and payment of taxes to the imperial power.
3.  **Proxy Administration**: The imperial power uses its own citizens, often businessmen or professionals, to manage its territories and extract resources.
4.  **Military Occupation**: In some cases, the imperial power maintains a military presence in the occupied territories, directly administering them through military governors or prefects.
5.  **Economic Domination**: Imperial powers may exert control over local economies by controlling trade routes, markets, and industries, often through monopoly or oligopoly.

These methods of administration can vary depending on the specific historical context and the nature of the imperial relationship.";155;7;8;42.73960828781128;20.94048648648649;91.67567567567568
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"Sir Isaac Newton formulated his three laws of motion in the late 17th century, and they were first published in his book ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy) in 1687. Since then, numerous scientists and physicists have contributed to our understanding of mechanics and built upon Newton's work.

It's difficult to pinpoint exactly when each improvement was made, but here are some key milestones:

1. **18th century**: Guillaume d'Alembert (1743) and Leonhard Euler (1765) developed the theory of rigid bodies and introduced concepts like angular momentum.
2. **19th century**:
	* Sadi Carnot (1824) laid the foundation for thermodynamics, which is closely related to Newton's laws.
	* Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1836) worked on the mathematics underlying Newton's laws, particularly in the context of calculus and differential equations.
	* William Rowan Hamilton (1833) developed the mathematical formalism of Lagrangian mechanics, which provides an equivalent formulation of Newton's laws.
3. **Early 20th century**:
	* Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity (1905) introduced a new perspective on time and space, modifying our understanding of classical mechanics.
	* Niels Bohr (1913) developed the Bohr model of the atom, which applied quantum principles to atomic behavior.
4. **20th century**:
	* Quantum Mechanics was fully formulated in the 1920s by pioneers like Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and Paul Dirac.
	* Relativity (special and general) became widely accepted and integrated into our understanding of gravity and spacetime.

In summary, it's been over three centuries since Newton first proposed his laws. The gradual improvements and refinements have led to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of mechanics, but it's difficult to attribute a specific ""completion"" or ""finalization"" date for these developments.";274;14;4;86.17345118522644;21.04238157894737;93.98684210526316
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"Islamism, a political ideology that seeks to implement Islamic law (sharia) in society, aims to integrate itself into various aspects of life. Some of the key areas where Islamists attempt to impose their influence include:

1.  **Politics**: Islamists often seek to establish an Islamic state or government, where sharia is the primary source of legislation. They may try to infiltrate and control political institutions, such as parliaments, governments, or even militaries.
2.  **Education**: Islamists attempt to shape education systems to conform to their ideology, promoting Islamist curricula, textbooks, and teaching methods that emphasize Islamic values and principles.
3.  **Social Services**: Islamists often establish social service organizations, such as charities, hospitals, schools, and orphanages, which serve as a means to promote their ideology and gain influence in local communities.
4.  **Media and Communication**: Islamists use various media outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television stations, radio stations, and online platforms, to disseminate their message, propagate Islamic values, and shape public opinion.
5.  **Cultural Institutions**: Islamists try to promote and preserve Islamic culture, art, and architecture, often by restoring or building mosques, madrasas (Islamic schools), and other cultural institutions that reflect Islamic heritage.
6.  **Family Law**: Islamists seek to implement sharia-based family laws, which can include strict rules on marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody.
7.  **Economy**: Some Islamist groups advocate for an Islamic economic system, known as ""Islamic finance,"" which is based on principles of sharia and seeks to promote social justice and equality in economic transactions.
8.  **Security and Defense**: In some cases, Islamists may seek to establish or join armed groups, such as militias or terrorist organizations, to protect their interests and impose their ideology through force.

These attempts can be seen in various countries around the world, including but not limited to those with a majority Muslim population.";298;11;4;87.51723265647888;20.671272727272736;89.25974025974025
20;When was the current parliament of Scotland convened?;Following a referendum in 1997;"The current Parliament of Scotland, also known as the Scottish Parliament, was reconvened on July 1, 1999. This marked the end of a period of over 300 years during which Scotland had no separate parliament.

Prior to this date, Scotland's government and legislative functions were exercised by the UK Parliament in London, with some aspects being devolved to the Scottish Office (a government department responsible for Scottish affairs) or to various statutory bodies such as the Scottish Development Agency.

The new Scottish Parliament was established under the Scotland Act 1998, which created a devolved parliament with powers over areas such as health, education, justice, and local government. The first session of the Scottish Parliament began on July 1, 1999, when the parliament held its inaugural meeting at Holyrood in Edinburgh.

However, it's worth noting that this is not the first Scottish Parliament to be convened in history. Scotland had a separate parliament from the 13th century until the Acts of Union in 1707, which united the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under a single government. The previous parliament was formally dissolved on May 25, 1707.

The current parliament is the fifth Scottish Parliament since its establishment in 1296, with the previous ones being:

1. 1296-1603: Edward I's parliament
2. 1612-1639: Charles I's parliament
3. 1661-1690: Charles II's parliament
4. 1707 (formally dissolved on May 25): The Parliament of Scotland was formally dissolved under the Acts of Union.

23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973;"The 1973 oil crisis, also known as the Oil Embargo, began on October 17, 1973. It was triggered by an Arab-Israeli war in which Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack against Israel on Yom Kippur (October 6-7). The United States and other Western countries had been providing military support to Israel at the time.

In response to the war, Saudi Arabia, led by King Faisal, announced that it would limit oil exports to Western countries. Other Arab oil-producing countries, including Libya, Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, followed suit. They formed an organization called OAPEC (Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries) to coordinate their efforts.

The OAPEC countries imposed an embargo on oil shipments to several Western countries, including the United States, Netherlands, Britain, Belgium, Italy, and Japan. The embargo lasted for about six months, until March 1974, when Saudi Arabia lifted its restrictions.

During this period, global oil prices skyrocketed by over 300%, leading to widespread shortages, rationing, and economic disruptions in many countries. The crisis had a significant impact on the world economy, contributing to high inflation rates, recession, and a rise in energy costs that lasted for years after the embargo was lifted.";199;7;2;55.484089851379395;20.86828571428572;93.59183673469387
24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries;"The term ""Norman"" refers to a specific group of people who originated from Scandinavia (specifically, present-day Denmark and Norway) and later settled in what is now the region of Normandy in northern France.

The first Viking raid on the Frankish kingdom, which included present-day Normandy, occurred in the late 8th century. However, it was not until the mid-9th century that the Vikings began to establish settlements and establish a presence in the area.

In around 911, the Viking leader Rollo (also known as Rolf) agreed with King Charles III of West Francia (the Frankish kingdom) to cede control of a territory he had conquered in Normandy in exchange for land and a guarantee of safe conduct. This marked the beginning of the Duchy of Normandy.

The descendants of these Viking settlers, who would become known as the Normans, began to adopt French culture and language over time. They intermarried with the local population, adopted Christianity, and eventually became one of the dominant forces in medieval France.

Over the next few centuries, the Normans developed a distinct identity, blending their Scandinavian heritage with their French surroundings. In 911, Rollo was granted the title of Duke of Normandy by Charles III, marking the beginning of the Duchy of Normandy as an independent entity within the Frankish kingdom.

So to answer your question, the Normans were in Normandy from around the early 9th century onwards, with their settlements and influence growing over the next few centuries.";243;6;4;65.69171905517578;20.85474137931035;91.06896551724138
25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;"When people in a society rebel against laws that they consider unfair, unjust, or oppressive, it's often referred to as:

1. **Civil Disobedience**: This term was coined by Henry David Thoreau, who argued that individuals have a moral obligation to disobey laws that are unjust. Civil disobedience can take many forms, from peaceful protests and sit-ins to more confrontational actions like blockades or occupations.
2. **Protest Movement**: A protest movement is a collective effort by individuals to bring attention to a perceived injustice or unfair law, often using non-violent means such as demonstrations, rallies, and boycotts.
3. **Social Activism**: Social activism involves collective action to promote social change and challenge unjust laws or systems. This can include organizing protests, lobbying for policy changes, and advocating for human rights.
4. **Resistance**: When individuals or groups actively resist an unfair law or system through various means, such as peaceful protest, civil disobedience, or more confrontational actions.

Examples of movements that have challenged unjust laws or social norms include:

* The Civil Rights Movement in the United States (1950s-1960s)
* The Anti-Apartheid Movement (1940s-1990s)
* The Women's Suffrage Movement ( late 19th and early 20th centuries)
* The LGBTQ+ rights movement (ongoing)
* The #MeToo movement (ongoing)

These examples illustrate how individuals can come together to challenge laws or social norms that are perceived as unfair, often leading to significant social change.";229;15;2;66.77777242660522;20.910830508474582;90.10169491525424
26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;"Primary law, also known as source material or legislation, refers to laws and regulations that have been enacted by a government. The main sources of primary law vary depending on the jurisdiction, but here are some common ones:

1. **Statutes**: Laws passed by a legislature (e.g., Congress in the United States) or a parliament (e.g., UK Parliament). Statutes are also known as acts, codes, or ordinances.
2. **Constitutions**: The supreme law of a country that outlines the framework and principles of governance. Constitutions often establish the powers of government and the rights of citizens.
3. **Regulations**: Rules issued by an executive agency or department to implement and enforce statutes. Regulations are also known as administrative regulations or secondary legislation.
4. **Ordinances**: Local laws passed by a municipal or county government, which may be specific to a particular area or community.
5. **Treaties**: Agreements between countries that have been ratified and become part of international law. Treaties can create obligations for the signatory countries and establish rules for their interactions.
6. **Decrees**: Laws passed by an executive authority, such as a monarch or president, often in emergency situations or under delegated authority.
7. **Proclamations**: Official announcements or decrees issued by a government to implement new policies or regulations.

In addition to these primary sources of law, there are also other important documents that may be considered secondary sources:

1. **Case law**: Court decisions and judicial opinions that interpret and apply statutes and regulations.
2. **Opinions of the attorney general**: Official interpretations of laws by the chief legal advisor to a government.
3. **Regulatory guidance**: Documents issued by regulatory agencies to clarify their policies and procedures.

These primary sources of law are fundamental to understanding the law in any jurisdiction, and they often form the basis for secondary sources like case law and commentaries.";302;8;5;82.27558207511902;20.84726027397263;92.34246575342466
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;"The Black Death, also known as the Plague, is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in present-day Mongolia and China. The exact origin of the plague is not well-documented, but based on historical records, scientific research, and archaeological findings, here's what is widely accepted:

**Initial Outbreak (1346-1353)**

The plague first appeared in the city of Koko-Tekin, which was a major trading center in the Mongol Empire. From there, it spread to other parts of Central Asia, including present-day Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.

**Spread to Europe**

In 1347, a fleet of Genoese ships arrived at the port city of Messina, Sicily, carrying infected rats and sailors who had been exposed to the disease in the East. The plague quickly spread throughout Italy, France, Spain, England, and other parts of Europe.

**Bubonic Plague**

The Black Death is caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis), which was carried by fleas on rats, mice, and other rodents. These rodents were infected with the bacteria in Central Asia, where they had been introduced to by humans. The disease spread rapidly through trade routes, including the Silk Road.

**Types of Plague**

There are three types of plague: bubonic, pneumonic, and septicemic. Bubonic plague is the most common form, characterized by swollen lymph nodes (buboes) in the groin, armpits, or neck. Pneumonic plague occurs when the bacteria infect the lungs, causing pneumonia-like symptoms. Septicemic plague is a rare but deadly form that causes blood poisoning.

**Estimated Mortality Rate**

The Black Death is estimated to have killed between 75 million and 200 million people in Europe alone, approximately 30-60% of the continent's population. The exact mortality rate is difficult to determine, as records are incomplete and biased.

**Modern Outbreaks**

Although the plague has largely been eradicated from Europe, it still exists today in some parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and South America. Modern outbreaks have occurred in several countries, including Madagascar (2017), China (2014-2015), and the United States (e.g., Los Angeles, 1924 San Francisco, 1900).

The origins of the Black Death highlight the interconnectedness of global trade routes, the importance of public health infrastructure, and the devastating impact that a single disease can have on human populations.";364;6;6;110.04763197898865;20.815306122448987;94.45918367346938
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching;"Paul Baran developed the concept of packet switching, which is a fundamental technology underlying modern computer networks and the Internet. In the 1960s, he proposed that data be broken into small packets and transmitted over a network as independent messages, rather than being sent as continuous streams of bits.

Baran's work on packet switching was done at RAND Corporation (Research and Development) in the early 1960s, with the aim of developing communication systems for defense applications. He published his seminal paper ""On Distributed Communications"" in 1964, which outlined the principles of packet switching and its advantages over traditional circuit-switched networks.

Packet switching has since become a cornerstone of modern networking technologies, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the Internet itself. It allows for efficient and reliable communication between devices on a network by breaking data into packets that can be transmitted independently, reassembled at their destination, and delivered in any order.

Baran's work on packet switching has had a lasting impact on the development of modern computer networks and is widely regarded as one of the most important contributions to networking technology in the 20th century.";190;5;10;49.22928762435913;20.94944186046513;93.53488372093024
29;When was the French and Indian War?;1754?1763;"The French and Indian War took place from 1754 to 1763. It was a conflict between the British Empire and the French Empire, with their respective Native American allies, in North America. The war began in May 1754 when a group of British colonists led by George Washington clashed with French forces in present-day Pennsylvania.

The war can be divided into several phases:

1. **Early clashes (1754-1755)**: The initial skirmishes took place in the Ohio River Valley, where British and French forces competed for control.
2. **Braddock's defeat (1755)**: In July 1755, a large British force led by General Edward Braddock was defeated by a smaller French army in present-day Pennsylvania.
3. **Monongahela campaign (1755-1756)**: The British launched several campaigns to drive the French from the region, but they were repelled.
4. **British victories (1757-1759)**: In 1757, the British won a series of battles, including the Battle of Louisbourg, which led to the capture of Quebec in 1759 and Montreal in 1760.
5. **Treaty of Paris (1763)**: The war officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, in which France ceded all its North American territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain.

The French and Indian War had significant consequences for both the British Empire and the colonies. It led to a massive debt that was eventually paid off by the colonists through taxes, contributing to growing tensions between the colonies and Great Britain. The war also set the stage for the eventual American Revolution.";252;7;1;73.36821913719177;20.898569230769247;93.83076923076923
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;"The agents that the immune system detects are known as antigens. Antigens are substances (such as proteins, carbohydrates, or other molecules) that can trigger an immune response and stimulate the production of antibodies or activate immune cells like T cells. They can be found on the surface of pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, as well as on damaged or foreign cells in the body.

When an antigen enters the body, it is recognized by specific immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells or macrophages, which then process and present pieces of the antigen to T cells. This recognition and presentation of antigens to the immune system allows the body to mount a targeted response against the invading pathogen or foreign substance.

There are also two other terms related to antigens:

* Immunogens: These are substances that can induce an immune response, but may not be present in all individuals.
* Epitopes (or antigenic determinants): These are specific regions on an antigen that are recognized by the immune system.";173;10;1;44.82888627052307;20.987435897435905;95.0
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;"The branch of theoretical computer science that deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship is **Computational Complexity Theory**.

More specifically, Computational Complexity Theory focuses on the study of the resources required to solve computational problems. This includes:

1. Time complexity: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete.
2. Space complexity: The amount of memory an algorithm uses.
3. Algorithmic efficiency: The comparison between different algorithms for solving a problem.

Computational Complexity Theory also deals with the study of classes of computational problems, such as:

* **P** (Polynomial Time): Problems that can be solved in polynomial time.
* **NP** (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time): Problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.
* **NP-complete**: A subset of NP problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP.

Computational Complexity Theory helps us understand the inherent limitations and capabilities of computational systems, and provides a framework for classifying problems by their complexity and relationship to other problems.";165;18;3;44.50445365905762;20.714435897435905;92.53846153846153

37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;"A interesting question!

According to etymological sources, the word ""imperialism"" comes from Latin. Specifically, it is derived from the Latin words:

* ""Imperium"", meaning ""empire"" or ""command""
* The suffix ""-alism"", which was a common way of forming nouns in Latin

So, the origins of the word ""imperialism"" can be traced back to the Latin language.

However, if you're looking for an ancient language that predates Latin, it's worth noting that Latin itself is a descendant of Proto-Indo-European (PIE), which was spoken around 4000-3000 BCE. So, in a broader sense, one could argue that the origins of ""imperialism"" are rooted in PIE.

But if you're asking about an ancient language with direct influence on the development of the word, Latin is the most likely candidate!";125;10;1;35.778027296066284;20.201666666666668;92.33333333333333

42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;"European Union (EU) law, also known as the acquis communautaire, refers to the comprehensive set of laws, policies, and regulations that govern the activities and relationships between the Member States of the European Union. EU law is a unique and complex body of law that has evolved over several decades through the interactions of national governments, institutions of the EU, and various other stakeholders.

**Sources of EU Law:**

EU law can be derived from several sources:

1. **Treaties:** The primary source of EU law is the Treaties, which establish the principles and objectives of the Union. There are two main treaties:
	* Treaty on European Union (TEU)
	* Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
2. **Regulations:** EU regulations have direct effect, meaning they become part of national law in all Member States without needing to be transposed into domestic legislation.
3. **Directives:** EU directives require Member States to adopt specific measures within a set timeframe, but they do not have direct effect.
4. **Decisions:** EU decisions are binding on the parties involved and can take various forms, such as individual decisions or framework decisions.
5. **Ratification by National Parliaments:** Many EU laws must be ratified by national parliaments before coming into force.

**Key Principles of EU Law:**

Some key principles that underlie EU law include:

1. **Primacy of EU Law:** In case of conflict, EU law takes precedence over national law.
2. **Direct Effect:** EU regulations and certain directives have direct effect, meaning they are directly applicable in all Member States.
3. **Proportionality:** EU laws should be proportionate to their objectives and not excessively burdensome for individuals or businesses.
4. **Non-Discrimination:** EU law seeks to promote equality and non-discrimination among citizens.

**EU Institutions:**

Several institutions are responsible for implementing, interpreting, and enforcing EU law:

1. **European Commission (EC):** Proposes and implements EU policies.
2. **Council of the European Union (EU Council):** Represents national governments in setting EU policies and adopting legislation.
3. **European Parliament (EP):** Represents the interests of EU citizens and scrutinizes EU institutions' actions.
4. **Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU):** Interprets EU law, ensures its uniform application across Member States.

**Impact of EU Law:**

EU law has a significant impact on various aspects of daily life, including:

1. **Free Movement:** The right to live, work, and study in any EU country.
2. **Trade and Competition Policy:** Encourages free trade and competition within the single market.
3. **Environmental Protection:** Establishes common standards for environmental protection and sustainability.
4. **Consumer Rights:** Provides protections for consumers, such as product safety and consumer credit rights.

In summary, European Union law is a complex body of rules that governs the activities of Member States and their citizens. Its key principles, sources, institutions, and impact all contribute to creating a single market and promoting integration among EU countries.";470;5;26;135.31645107269287;20.888966942148766;95.40495867768595
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"Philosophers in Antiquity, particularly Aristotle (384-322 BCE), used the concept of ""ergon"" (ἔργον) to study and understand simple machines.

In Greek philosophy, ergon referred to a device or mechanism that performs a specific task, such as lifting heavy objects. Aristotle's work ""Mechanica"" is considered one of the earliest systematic treatises on mechanics. In it, he analyzed various simple machines, including levers, pulleys, and inclined planes, using the concept of ergon.

Aristotle identified several key aspects of a machine's ergon:

1. The purpose or function ( telos) that it serves.
2. The material components ( hyle) used to build the machine.
3. The way in which these components are arranged to perform the desired task.

By examining simple machines through the lens of ergon, Aristotle and other ancient philosophers aimed to understand how they worked, their relative efficiencies, and their limitations.

Later on, as mechanics evolved into a distinct field, this concept influenced the development of kinematics and the study of machines in medieval Europe.";164;11;4;47.754048585891724;20.858476190476203;93.35714285714286
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"While private schools and public schools have many similarities, there are some key differences in their structure, funding, and operational rights. Here are some of the main advantages or ""rights"" that private schools typically enjoy:

1. **Freedom from government oversight**: Private schools are not subject to the same level of government regulation as public schools. They can set their own policies, procedures, and standards without needing approval from local or state authorities.
2. **Autonomy in curriculum design**: Private schools have the flexibility to create their own curricula, which may include elective courses or special programs that aren't available in public schools.
3. **Higher degree of parental involvement**: Since private schools are often smaller and more personalized, parents tend to be more involved in decision-making processes and have a greater say in school governance.
4. **Flexibility in admissions and tuition policies**: Private schools can set their own admission standards, selectivity levels, and tuition rates, which allows them to create a unique student body and financial model.
5. **More control over budgeting and resource allocation**: With private funding sources (e.g., tuition, donations), private schools have more control over their budgets and can allocate resources as needed to support specific programs or initiatives.
6. **Ability to offer specialized courses and programs**: Private schools may be able to offer advanced or specialized courses in areas like the arts, music, or foreign languages, which might not be feasible for public schools due to budget constraints.
7. **Potential for more generous financial aid packages**: Private schools often have more flexible policies regarding financial aid, scholarships, and other forms of assistance, which can make them a more accessible option for families from diverse economic backgrounds.

However, it's essential to note that these advantages come with trade-offs:

1. **Higher costs**: Tuition fees at private schools are often significantly higher than those for public schools.
2. **Limited accessibility**: Private schools may not be inclusive of students from lower-income families or those requiring special educational services.
3. **Lack of accountability**: Without government oversight, some private schools may struggle to ensure equity and access for all students.

Keep in mind that these differences can vary depending on the specific school, location, and context.";362;10;4;94.78247165679932;20.860380952380986;94.86904761904762

* Coastal areas with coral reefs
* Estuaries and bays
* Open ocean waters
* Brackish waters (mix of fresh and saltwater)

Some species of ctenophores are also known to be pelagic, meaning they drift freely in the water column, while others may be more attached to surfaces or sediment.

Examples of specific habitats where ctenophores can be found include:

* The Atlantic Ocean
* The Pacific Ocean
* The Indian Ocean
* The Mediterranean Sea
* The Red Sea
