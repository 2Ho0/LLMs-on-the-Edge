1;What is Southern California often abbreviated as?;SoCal;"Southern California, a region known for its diverse landscapes and vibrant cultural scene within the U.CTerritories of Mexico's Baja Peninsula lies approximately between latitudes 32°N-34°N along the Pacific coastline. It is divided into three regions: Greater Los Angeles (the City proper, Long Beach), Central California, and Southern California’s most populous region inland – San Bernardino County.
The area extends from Mexico to about north of Santa Barbara at 1054 km length along the Pacific coastline while its width ranges up to nearly 392km across a significant portion of which is covered by mountains, valleys and deserts on both sides as well within itself — Los Angeles County alone has over 80 mountain peaks.
In terms of climate it’s best known for having Mediterranean influence with dry summers but cold winter night temperatures ranging from freezing to just above-freezing during evenings however these patterns vary widely depending on where precisely one stands within the region — whether near San Diego Bay or deep inland past Palmdale towards Mojave Desert fringes, etc..
Southern Californians enjoy a rich history dating back centuries before European contact when it was home to Native American groups such as Chumash (on Catalina Island) and Tongva/Gabrielino (inland). These indigenous societies were highly skilled in pottery making, basket weaving etc. however they had no knowledge of metalworking which would come much later with the arrival foreign settlers during colonial times.
The first permanent Euro-American settlement was established at Alta California by Spanish missionaries led by Father Junipero Serra who arrived on shore near present day San Diego Bay in 1769 he built numerous missions across this new territory including Santa Barbara which still stands today despite being abandoned for decades after Mexican independence from Spain forced many native converts back into their original ways once again (although non-native immigrants continued settling here).
In the late XIX century, Southern California’s agriculture flourished due to its mild climate allowing year round growing seasons but this changed during World War II when large numbers migrated from rural areas seeking work in Los Angeles causing rapid urbanization post war era brought on more development with highways built throughout city centers creating traffic jams and environmental concerns such as smog becoming increasingly apparent despite efforts towards clean air policies since then.
Today it remains one of America’s most diverse metropolitan areas – home to millions from all walks life including immigrants who brought cultural traditions across borders blending seamlessly into American melting pot society- giving rise various cuisines like Mexican (tacos), Italian(Pizza) alongside fusion dishes inspired by these influences but still uniquely southern Californian in their own right – all while enjoying sunny days year round thanks largely to marine layer offshore pacific currents bringing cool seaside temperatures during hot summer months however winters can be surprisingly cold with chinook wind rushes down mountain slopes causing sudden temperature drops- sometimes referred as ‘Southern California weather roulette’ among locals!
As far back into history goes, many artifacts unearthed in various places within Southern Californian soil indicate that its rich cultural heritage dates even further than indigenous cultures alone – from prehistoric Native American settlement sites discovered through archaeological digging to remnants of Spanish missions built by early settlers each one tells stories about past societies living here long before modern times began shaping this region into what we know today.
Southern California is a diverse and dynamic place with much more than meets the eye when it comes downrightly abbreviating SC as Southern Cal or SCA for short! So next time someone asks where you’re from, don’t forget to tell them all about life on ‘The Golden Coast.’ Whether talking politics/economy societal impacts tourism etc., remember that every detail makes up this intricate tapestry known simply as Southern California- home sweet home.";0.004125764;5.402418625;0.013;5.384;891;9;2;162.4

3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava);Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava. When this molten material cools beneath the Earth'an crust, it forms intrusive (or plutonic) igneous rocks with large mineral crystals due to slow cooling rates that allow for larger crystal growths examples include granite and diorite. On contrast, when lava erupts from a volcano or fissure on the Earth'an surface and cools rapidly, it forms extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks with fine-grained textures because of quick cooling rates that do not allow large crystals to form examples include basalt and rhyolite.;0.003924177;1.15947077;0.01;1.144;158;15;13;142.255

5;Along with geothermal and nuclear, what is a notable non-combustion heat source?;solar power;"One notable non-combustion heat source alongside geothermal energy and nuclear power is solar thermal energy. Solar thermal plants use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a small area of high-efficiency solar receivers, which convert the light into heat that can then be used directly for heating water in residential homes or industrial processes, produced electrical power through turbines coupled with steam engines, or converted into chemical energy via photovoltaic cells.

Solar thermal systems have been widely adopted around the world and are particularly suited to hot climates where sunlight is abundant year-round. They offer a renewable alternative for space heating, water heating, swimming pools, drying clothes or crops, industrial processing, etc. Unlike solar photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight directly into electricity without involving heat production, Solar thermal plants provide an option where concentrated heat is harnessed as a direct form of energy for various applications and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing fossil fuel-based heating solutions. 

Another non-combustion source worth mentioning is biomass, which includes organic materials such as wood chips or agricultural residues that are burned for heat without direct combustion in a flame – instead using gasification to convert the material into syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) under controlled conditions. This process can be done with an air-blown reactor, known as 'air stok feed,' or one that uses steam for better control over the reaction environment without combustion – in this case referred to as a 'steam gasifier.' Both methods convert biomass into usable heat energy but do so through chemical transformation rather than direct flame heating.

Please note, while these sources provide alternatives to traditional fossil fuel-based systems and reduce carbon emissions when used wisely within sustainable practices, they still require careful consideration of resource availability, environmental impacts (particularly in the case of biomass), technological maturity, economic viability, as well as social acceptance.";0.003937557;2.851621906;0.011;2.835;467;18;2;181.94
6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, also known as the unique factorization theorem, highlights the pivotal role that prime numbers play in number theory. This foundational theorem states that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be factored into prime numbers through multiplication, and this representation—using only primes—is unique for each case (excluding the order of factors). For example, while both \(2 \times 3 \times 5\) and \(5 \times 3 \times 2\) are valid decompositions to represent the number 30 as a product of prime numbers, they're essentially considered identical in terms of their composition for fundamental purposes. This theorem underscdests how primes serve as building blocks within mathematics that can be used to express all natural numbers uniquely through multiplication and division, underpinning many other concepts and theorems in number theory.;0.003660405;1.249832898;0.014;1.231;191;15;9;158.075
7;What kind of university is the University of Chicago?;a private research university;"The University of Chicago is a private research university that was established in 1890. It's located on an urban campus setting within downtinburg, Illinois and it boasts some distinctive characteristics: 

- Founded by John D. Rockefeller with the help of influential philanthropist Robert R. McCormick along with generous gifts from William Rainey Morris, led to its foundation as an institution that would provide a rigorous education grounded in liberal arts and sciences while also focusing on critical thinking skills.
- Known for being one of the most prestigious universities globally according to various world university rankings such as QS World University Rankings, it is recognized especially within humanities disciplines but has made strides across many other fields including business, social sciences and law which often score particularly well on these global scales.
- As a research institution with an extensive alumni network that includes 53 Nobel laureates (more than any other university in the world), it is renowned for its interdisciplinary approach to education where traditional subject divisions are less emphasized, fostering what's been called 'The Chicago School of Sociology'.
- The University also has a significant urban setting which allows students unique opportunities like field trips into local industries or internships with nearby companies. This blend contributes towards its reputation as an environment where the academic and professional world intersect in meaningful ways, producing graduates who are not only well educated but practically experienced within their chosen fields of study before they even finish undergraduate studies at UChicago.
- As a public university chartered by law that is governed by the University's Corporation (an 1890 Act), it operates on an enriching financial model which combines state funding, endowment income and tuition fees to maintain its world-class programs for both undergraduate studies as well as graduate research. The institution also extends scholarship opportunities through the University of Chicago Prizes that are awarded annually in various disciplines across humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences - furthering education beyond mere affordability constraints often experienced by students from less privileged backgrounds trying to access higher learning institutions worldwide at this level.
- As a comprehensive research university it offers over 40 undergraduate majors with specialized tracks for graduate school studies such as Law, Business Administration (Booth School of Business) or Social Service Work which are often cited among top universities globally by various ranking bodies like URAP. Furthermore there's also extensive study abroad opportunities that take place on six continents due to the university’s networked presence in numerous locations around and beyond these, providing unique cultural experiences alongside academic growth for its students worldwide - making it one of just a few universities globally known as 'Global Universities'.
- With an impressive faculty comprising 90% full professors which includes several members from departments like Physics Nobel Laureate Robert H. Grubbs or sociologists such Steven E. Landsburg, it has been consistently ranked among top universities globally for quality teaching - making its undergraduate learning experience as valuable and engaging today compared to when the university was first founded over a century ago!
- Lastly with nearly 20% of all graduate students participating in research activities across various departments including Biology or Economics, it's one such institution where both theory & practice are intertwined seamlessly within its educational fabric - preparing them for successful academic and professional lives ahead!";0.004038931;4.436245538;0.005;4.426;766;10;4;200.875
8;What is the second most abundant element?;helium;"The third most abundant element in Earth's crust, after oxygen and silicon, is aluminum. It makes up about 8% of the Earth’seligent to say that without knowing what specific elements you are referring to as 'X', I can only speculate on which one might be considered a rare resource yet essential for modern technology in your context. If by ""rare resources"" we mean naturally occurring, easily accessible minerals and considering technological advancements like semiconductors (which rely heavily on specific elements), it's possible you could be referring to gallium or indium—both are used in various high-tech applications but do not occur freely in nature.

However, if by rare resources we mean minerals that require complex processing and have limited availability despite being relatively common in the Earth’s crust due to their low concentrations (like lithium or cobalt), then gallium might indeed be a good fit as it is essential for modern technology but not often found alone, primarily occurring within other minerals such as monazite sands.

To provide you with the most accurate and helpful response, I would need to know more about which elements or resources your original question was referring to.

10;What is the worlds largest academic and private library system?;Harvard Library;"The answer to your question can be somewhat ambiguous, as there are several large network of libraries with millions of volumes each. However, one could argue that The New York Public Library (NYPL) might have one of the most recognized names in this context due its size and influence since it holds over five million items including books, manuscripts, journals, newspapers, magazines, music scores, maps, prints, photographs, sound recordings, DVDs & Blu-ray Discs. It also has several major research libraries across New York City as well a network of 18 branches in the Bronx and Manhattan alone with an additional five branch locations throughout Brooklyn to be exact.

On the other hand, The British Library is among one of Europe's largest library systems - it holds about nine million items including books (printed after 1500) but also manuscripts, newspapers journals and maps in its collections spread across several libraries all over London as well holding millions more stored away.

Another massive system would be the Library of Congress which operates within Washington D.C., holds about 171 million items with books making up a significant portion but also has music, sound recordings, films and video materials to consider too – this library was established by an act of U.S congress in 1800 and is the largest national library globally holding vast collections from around world covering all subjects including science - it holds over six million items which have been published since its foundation or received as gifts, grants or purchases afterward but this number continues to grow rapidly every year.

Yet another massive entity would be The Paris National Library and Music (BnF) with more than 48 millions volumes in French at their disposal making it one of Europe's largest academic libraries – located inside its building alone, BNF holds about two million items dating back to the ninth century!

It is important to note that library size isn't solely measured by physical volume - as digital resources become increasingly essential for researchers worldwide. The Internet Archive & Google Scholar are massive online repositories of freely accessible eBooks, academic journals etc which arguably makes them justifiably significant contributors in terms of sheer information content alone without even considering their growth rate or potential reach via internet accessibility (although these platforms do not provide the full range and depth available at many traditional libraries).

In conclusion, it is difficult to pinpoint a single ""world's largest"" academic library system as there are numerous substantial networks of both publicly-accessible lending institutions along with specialized research repositories across our planet today. The Library of Congress in Washington D.C., United States the British Library within London City center, UK and New York Public Library network throughout NYC could arguably be contenders due to their respective size (volume count), historical significance/importance & global outreach via physical as well online accessibility channels respectively which make each of these unparalleled academic library systems.";0.003511656;3.957105698;0.012;3.94;643;11;2;182.72500000000002

13;Where was France's Huguenot population largely centered?;the southern and central parts of France;The French Huguenots, also known as the Protestants of France during the 16th and 17th centuries, were primarily concentrated in central and southern regions. They settled significantly in Alsace (particularly cities like Strasbourg), Burgundy (such as Dijon and Besançon), Lyons, and also found refuge in Normandy near Paris.

14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;Ctenophora, commonly known as comb jellies or sea walnuts, are a phylum of invertebrate marine organisms. They get their name from the rows of gelatinous plates down their backsides, which they use for locomotion by beating them together to achieve movement through water this process creates the distinctive shimmering effect produced by rainbow-like colors that refract light – hence comb jellies are bioluminescent. Ctenophores exhibit radial symmetry and have two layers of cells with an inner layer called diploblastic tissue, similar to cnidarians but lack the stinging cells present in true jellyfish (Cnidaria). Instead, many species possess sticky tentacles for capturing prey such as small fish or zooplankton. They play a significant ecological role within marine environments and are considered important indicators of water quality since they feed on plankton that respond to changes in environmental conditions.;0.003584829;1.260316998;0.005;1.25;215;9;9;193.1

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;"Imperialism, which refers to the policy or practice of extending a nation's rule over other lands typically by force or coercion. It has historically been implemented through various administrative methods:

1. **Direct Rule** - In this form, imperial powers establish colonies where they maintain direct control and governance is often centralized under their own administrators or officials appointed from the metropolitan power's government. This was evident in European colonial empires such as Britain in India with its Viceroyalty system, France in Algeria which had an overarching administration by French officials known as ""gouverneurs,"" and Spain during the Spanish conquest of the Americas where direct control replaced local governance structures under figures like Hernán Cortés.

2. **Spheres of Influence** - Imperial powers, especially in China before its revolution at mid-twentieth century or Africa post World War I era (the so-called ""Scramble for Africa""), might not have direct rule but exercised substantial influence over certain regions without annexing them directly. While they did impose economic dependencies and political control to some degree, it was often through treaties with local rulers who were sometimes coerced into submission or by the manipulation of existing power dynamics within a region like in Russia's relationship with Persia (present-day Iran).

3. **Indirect Rule** - This method relies on pre-existing political structures to administer colonial rule and maintain control, as seen through systems such as ""Native Rulers"" or indirect governance under British protectorates in Africa like Nigeria's Northern and Southern Provinces during the late 19th century.

4. **Neocolonialism** - Post-colonial era imperialistic practices where control is maintained not by direct military or political force, but through economic pressure or other forms of soft power such as cultural dominance often involving multinational corporations that exert significant influence over the economies and politics of less powerful countries.

5. **Military Intervention** - Occasional use where imperial powers might deploy military forces to assert control, either directly through invasion (e.g., US-led interventions in Afghanistan) or indirectly by supporting certain factions within a country against others for strategic interests.

6. **Cultural Imperialism** - Spread of language, values, and customs often associated with the imperial power to dominate through cultural assimilation as seen during colonial times when European languages were imposed in African colonies or North America's influence on Latin American cultures.";0.004020328;3.397239193;0.011;3.381;558;9;11;183.28500000000003
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"The process and understanding of improving upon Sir Isaac Newton’s Laws of Motion has spanned several centuries. Following his publication in the late seventeenth century, notable advancements occurred with:

- The development of non-inertial frame theories by Giulio Pontedotti in the 18th and early 19th centuries, which expanded upon Newton's Laws to explain phenomena involving rotating frames. This included understanding effects like fictitious forces that don’t appear when using an inertial frame of reference as prescribed by Newton himself.
  
- The advent of Special Relativity theory at the beginning of 20th century, most notably developed by Albert Einstein between 1905 and 1916 to address situations where objects approach light speed or live within strong gravitational fields—conditions under which classical mechanics fails. This fundamentally changed our understanding of motion as it introduced the concept that time is relative based on observer's frame of reference, a notion beyond Newtonian physics conceptions.
  
- The formulation and subsequent refinement of General Relativity theory by Einstein between 1915 and mid 20th century which revolutionized our understanding of gravity not as a force (as in the case with gravitational attraction) but rather as curvature of space-time caused by massive objects. This provided an accurate description for strong gravitational fields such as near black holes, where Newton's laws cease to apply accurately.
  
It is difficult to pinpoint when exactly ""improvements"" began since these developments were not simply tweaks but rather fundamentally new theories that superseded and expanded upon the original framework of Newton’s Laws within specific contexts where they no longer applied perfectly or completely, such as at relativistic speeds. However, one could argue that major refinements started in earnest with Einstein's theory which took over from 1905 onwards for a range of conditions beyond the scope of classical mechanics and Newtonian physics.";0.003406631;2.739190442;0.024;2.711;439;17;4;164.82999999999998
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;"Islamism seeks to influence various aspects of society, including political governance, cultural norms, education systems and individual behaviors based on its interpretation of Sharia or Islamic law. It often aims for the establishment of an Islamic state where public life is heavily influenced by religious principles derived from the Quran and Hadith (sayings and actions of Prophet Muhammad). 

Some specific ways in which Islamism might integrate itself into aspects of life include:

1. Governance - An Islamist regime may prioritize Sharia law as its primary legal system, promoting policies based on religious principles that affect all areas of governance from criminal justice to social services and economic regulations. 
2. Education systems – In an attempt to shape the future generations' mindset in accordance with their ideology, Islamists may seek control over education by creating curriculum centered around Quranic teachings while also possibly restricting access to secular or non-Islamist content. 
3. Cultural norms – An aspect of life that might be impacted is cultural traditions and practices as well this can range from modesty dress code, gender roles in society to other social customs like prayer times and the concept of halal/haram (permissible or forbidden) behavior.
4. Individual behaviors – Islamists aim for individual actions aligning with their belief system through promoting religious practices such as daily prayers, fasting during Ramadan and charity giving among other things based on teachings in the Qur'an and Hadiths. 
5. Media - Many proponents of Islamism believe that media should reflect Islamic values and thus might seek control over broadcast media or online content to promote their religious beliefs through books, songs, music videos etc. which align with Sharia principles.";0.003520647;2.506892169;0.01;2.492;393;15;5;181.965

22;"How much was the combined wealth of the ""10 Million dollar millionaires"" in 2008?";nearly $41 trillion;"The term ""10 Million Dollar Millionaires"" is not a standard classification used by financial institutions or market research. However, if we interpret this as individuals who have accumulated personal wealth of at least $10 million each, the combined total would depend on how many people fall into that category in 2008 and their specific net worths.

If such data were available from a credible source like Forbes' list or similar publications for that year, one could sum up individual wealth amounts to estimate this figure. However, without exact figures pertaining specifically to individuals with precisely $10 million in assets (excluding real estate and other non-liquid investments), providing an accurate number would be impossible. The closest approximation might involve identifying the group of ultra-high net worth individuals commonly referred to as ""Ultra High Net Worth Individuals"" or UHNWI, who are typically defined by Forbes based on liquid assets exceeding $30 million each (as per their 2nerdweary methodology).

As a rough estimate in that vein, the Bloomberg Billionaires Index reported approximately 148 individuals as billionaires worldwide in early 2008. This is still far from reaching ""The Ten Million Dollar Club,"" but it gives an idea of how many people could potentially fit into such a wealth bracket if their assets were liquid and combined with others who meet this threshold, albeit not accurately representing individuals worth exactly $10 million each in 2008.

For real data concerning the world's billionaires or even UHNWIs from that time period, one could refer to resources like:

- Forbes Magazine – which publishes an annual list of ""The World’s Billionaires."" While they typically report on individuals with assets exceeding $30 million (UHNWI), the 2008 data would likely reflect a significantly lower number, given economic conditions around that time. Nevertheless, this could serve as a reference point for estimating high net worth in dollar terms if adjusted accordingly to represent liquid wealth only.
- Bloomberg – which also publishes an annual list of billionaires with their respective assets and provides historical data on the trend over years using various investment types including equities, real estate, personal property, etc. As mentioned above, UHNWI would generally be categorized as those individuals worth more than $30 million in liquid assets alone however, for specific figures around 10 million dollars per individual (if such a category existed), one might have to extrapolate data from the broader billionaire list provided by Bloomberg.
- Credit Suisse – which compiles annual reports on global wealth with detailed insights into high net worth individuals across different regions, though their methodology would also primarily focus on liquid assets and may classify UHNWI differently than Forbes or Bloomberg does based purely on asset values that include non-liquid investments.
- Global Wealth Mapping – initiatives like the World Inequality Database by the Paris School of Economics provide insights into wealth distribution across different countries, but these typically aggregate data rather than presenting individual figures and may not specifically target a dollar amount such as $10 million per person unless they adjust for inflation.
- Research papers – academic studies on global wealth often explore patterns in high net worth individuals' behavior during market cycles or crises (such as the 2008 financial downt0urn). Such research might give insights into how much money was concentrated within certain segments of ultra-high net worth populations, though such data would still be challenging to pin down precisely for each individual.

It's essential always to verify that any wealth estimates are current and reflective of the most recent financial conditions if they aim to approximate historical figures accurately. The economic impact on personal wealth in 2008 was significant due to various factors, including market volatility leading up to and during the initial stages of the global financial crisis sparked by concerns surrounding subprime mortgages and related credit instruments. This led many individuals who were nearing a million dollars or more in net worth to experience substantial losses as markets fluctuated dramatically throughout that period, further complicating an accurate historical estimate without precise data points for each individual's wealth at the time.";0.003570983;5.819178064;0.006;5.808;932;18;4;195.90500000000003

The establishment dates back to circa 911 AD when the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte granted land between the rivers Epte and Alençon to Rollo, a Viking leader who agreed to swear fealty to King Charles the Simple and convert to Christianity under certain terms.

The Duchy itself became fully established in 960 AD when Lothair of France died without an heir, leading Count Richard I's forces (with Norman backing) to seize control over Normandy as its new leader, establishing a stronghold for the Vikings who settled there—often referred to as ""Normans"" due to their Norse heritage. The Duchy of Normandy lasted until 1259 when King Henry III of England seized it and gave it back after military conflict with France – though its people continued to identify themselves by that term well into the subsequent centuries, notably in events like the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.";0.003477984;1.505074498;0.005;1.495;254;8;5;191.315
25;What is it called when people in society rebel against laws they think are unfair?;Civil disobedience;When individuals or groups within a society feel that certain laws, regulations, or policies imposed upon them are unjust and contrary to their moral values or societal norms, this collective sentiment can lead to acts of civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is the intentional act of breaking specific laws in nonviolent ways as a form of protest against government actions perceived as unfair by those who participate. This concept has been famously associated with figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., both utilizing civil disobedience to challenge unjust systems without resorting to violence, aiming instead for dialogue, understanding, or policy change through nonviolent means. Civil disobedience can take many forms, including sit-ins, marches, boycotts, and drafts of petitions calling for reform. While it challenges the legal framework by violating laws deemed unfair, civil disobedience is a form of political expression grounded in principles such as moral conscience and social justice rather than personal gain or revenge against specific individuals within government structures.;0.004113447;1.509672852;0.014;1.491;234;16;2;165.98499999999999
26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;"The main sources of primary law typically include:

1. Constitutions, which serve as the fundamental legal framework for a country or jurisdiction and have supremiser authority over other laws within that region they define government structure, citizens' rights, powers, duties among others, thereby providing the foundation on which all subsequent legislation is built upon. 

2. Statutes (or Acts of Parliament), representing formal written enactments made by a federal or local legislative body and applicable throughout their respective jurisdictions these are specific laws passed to address certain issues within that governing body's purview, such as taxation law, environmental policy etc.

3. Regulations (or Rules), which represent detailed provisions issued by the executive branch of government or its authorized entities aimed at implementing and administering statutory laws these may cover areas like healthcare regulation, company law, labor rights among others. 

4. Case Law / Common Law, representing legal precedents established through decisions in prior court cases (particularly courts of higher jurisdiction) that provide interpretations or rulings on specific issues - the principle here is ""stare decisis"" which implies standing by previous similar judgments unless there's a compelling reason to deviate.

5. Treaties and conventions, representing formal agreements between different countries regarding shared interests these have international legal authority when ratified but can vary in direct applicability from country-to-country depending on how they are incorporated into domestic law.";0.003452918;2.097970561;0.009;2.084;327;9;6;181.78
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;The Black Death, also known as bubonic plague, is believed to have originated in Asia. The most commonly cited area of origin for this devastating pandemic that swept through Europe and parts of Asia between 1347-1351 AD is China or Central Asia, where the disease was caused by a specific strain of bacteria called Yersinia pestis. Historical records indicate it initially arrived in Sicily around September 1347 via Genoese trading ships coming from the Black Sea ports in what are now Russia and Ukraine—areas that were then part of Mongol-controlled territories, which could suggest a possible link to these regions as well before reaching Europe.;0.005856867;0.947691615;0.006;0.934;155;8;6;172.755

31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;The area within theoretic computer science that categorizes computational difficulties into classes is known as **Complexity Theory**. Within this field, researchers study complexity classes which include both P (problems solvable in polynomial time) and NP-hard or NP-complete problems (problems for which no efficient solving algorithm has been found yet). The most notable distinction within these complexities is between the class of **NP** (nondeterministic polynomial time), where solutions can be verified quickly, but finding a solution may not necessarily be fast. Problems in NP include famous challenges like the Traveling Salesman and SAT problems. Complexity theory often seedependent on reductions showing that one problem is at least as difficult as another (e.g., reducing an instance of 3-SAT to CNF satisfiability) or shows a polynomial speedup over brute force algorithms for some classes, providing insights into the inherent difficulty and relationships between various computational problems.;0.003955766;1.439802242;0.01;1.424;209;21;4;173.475

33;What percentile of gross domestic product is construction comprised of?;six to nine percent;"To find the percentage contribution of construction to a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one needs specific economic data from reliable sources such as national statistics agencies or international organizations like the World Bank. The information typically involves sectoral breakdowns where each major industry, including construction, contributes its portion to total economic output measured in monetary terms over a defined period, usually annually for countries with developed statistical systems.

Unfortunately, without referring to specific data from either an authoritative government source or the World Bank's database on sector contributions to GDP:
- No single answer can be provided as this varies greatly between nations and even within different economies of a country due to regional development disparities, industrial focus shifts over time, seasonal trends (especially in countries with significant construction industries), and varying accounting methods.
- The data would need constant updates since national GDPs change annually based on economic growth or recession investment patterns shift as infrastructure demands evolve technological advancements can lead to changes within the industry itself, all impacting its percentage of contribution to GDP.

In general terms, in developed countries with stable economies and mature industries across sectors like manufacturing or services, construction may account for a smaller fraction—sometimes as low as 2-3%. In contrast, developing nations where rapid infrastructure growth is commonplace might see this figure double or even triple.

To get accurate data about the percentage of GDP that comes from the construction sector in any particular country at a specific time point:
1. Visit an official government statistical agency's website for their latest economic reports and breakdown tables (like Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Accounts Division). For example, this would be available through national statistics bureaus like Eurostat or the US Census Bureau in countries such as the United States where data is consistently updated.
2. Access international databases provided by organizations with a global perspective on economies and GDP contributions (like World Bank's ""World Development Indicators,"" International Monetner Organization, etc.) to compare between nations or regions for broader insights into construction sector size relative to overall economic activity across countries as of the year in question.
3.

36;University of Chicago scholars played a major part in what development?;various academic disciplines;"The University of Chicago has been at the forefront of many significant developments across different fields since its establishment. Here are three notable contributions by UChicago alumni and faculty:

1. Economic Theory - Milton Friedman, an economics professor who joined in 1946 before becoming a world-renowned figure known for his free market ideologies which have deeply influenced economic thought globally through books like ""Capitalism and Freedom"" (1962) and the introduction of monetarism.

2. Criminology - Robert Sampson, who has served as an influential sociologist at UChicago since 1984 with a focus on urban poverty, community disorganization, crime patterns among minority communities in Chicago neighborhoods his research is key to understanding the social factors contributing to criminal behavior.

3. Medicine - The University of Chicago has also been influential within medicine through its pioneering work at their Pritzker School of Medicine which led to advances such as: 
   a. Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn's discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that replenishes the ends of chromosomes and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (2009).
   b. The development of minimally invasive heart surgery techniques by surgeons at UChicago's Pritzker School of Medicine, including Dr. Daniel Hales who has done groundbreaking work on mitral valve repair and transcatheter closure for congenital defects which improved patients’ recovery times significantly since the early 2000s.

42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;"European Union law refers to the legal system that governs all aspects of life within the member states of the European Union (EU). It encompasses a range of areas including competition, social policy, agriculture and fisheries, regional development, consumer protection, transportation, and environmental regulation. EU laws are made by institutions in accordance with democratic processes that allow input from both elected representatives and the citizens directly using initiatives and referenda where relevant. 

At its core, European Union law is about creating a more integrated Europe through shared rules and policies designed to protect human rights, promote social justice, create an internal market of free movement for goods, services, people, and capital, ensure sustainable development in harmony with the environment, uphold democracy as well as ensuring security within the European Union.

The primary sources of EU law are treaties that were negotiated by its member states secondary legislation including regulations which apply directly to all members without a national-law requirement and directives requiring implementation into national laws for them to take effect, court decisions made in cases involving interpretation or application of the Treaties (the Court of Justice), and opinions from advisory bodies such as committees. The European Union law interacts with individual countries' legal systems through principles like supremacy where EU law takes precedence over national laws if there is a conflict, but this also raises issues about democratic accountability and control given that many aspects of the legislative process are not directly accessible to individuals in most member states.";0.003450001;2.009946071;0.008;1.997;327;6;30;180.28

44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"Private schools typically possess the autonomy to make independent decisions regarding their curriculum, teaching methods, and policies not usually within the purview of public schools. They also often charge tuition fees, whereas most state-funded public schools provide education free at the point of service for all children residing in a given district based on where they live or go to school.

In addition, private institutions are generally governed by their own board members rather than elected officials like local city councils or boards which often influence educational decisions and funding within public schools. They also have the flexibility to incorporate religious teachings if desired without fear of federal lawsuit as they would in a public school setting, although some private institutions may still offer secular education options for those who prefer it.

Furthermore, many states provide tax benefits or exemptions that can directly benefit families choosing private schools over public ones by reducing their financial burden when sending children to private educational settings instead of the local district's school. Lastly, some parents choose a privately-funded education because they seek specialized programs not widely available in public institutions like language immersion or Montessori methods that are often adopted and refined exclusively by independent schools due to their relative autonomy from governmental control.

It is essential to note the distinction between what private entities can offer within legal constraints, as some rights granted may vary based on local laws and regulations therefore it's always advisable for parents seeking information about these differences in educational options or services that they contact relevant education offices directly.";0.003530814;2.118462431;0.009;2.104;331;13;4;180.085
45;What is the largest stadium in Australia?;Melbourne Cricket Ground;"The Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) located in Melbourne, Victoria is arguably considered to be one of the biggest and most historic sports venues worldwide. In terms of capacity for a single sporting event like football or rugby matches, it has been reported that MCG can host up to approximately 100,00 end-of-season concerts with an audience size reaching almost half a million people at full house!

However, if we're talking about the largest stadium in Australia based on seating capacity for different types of events (in general), then it would be the Sydney Cricket Ground which has hosted numerous international rugby matches and can seat up to around 45,000 spectators. In terms of purely sports-centric venues that accommodate a large number of people at once across all sporting disciplines—not just one event type or occasion—then the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) might hold an edge over MCG with its larger and versatile capacity for multiple uses, including Australian Rules Football events.

In summary, depending on specific definitions like 'largest stadium based solely on sports function' versus 'most historic or multi-purpose venue', the answer can vary between the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) with a 45,000 capacity and Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), which has an enduring legacy but primarily caters to cricket.";0.003489225;1.92929947;0.009;1.915;309;8;3;181.34
46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters;Ctenophores, commonly known as comb jellies, are marine invertebrates.

48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;"The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (often simply referred to as ""the Council"") jointly form what is known as EU institutions. They work in tandem with other key organs such as the European Commission, but it’s important not confuse them as separate entities for which they have distinct functions within governing the bloc of 27 Member States (and previously the 28th State – The United Kingdom).

The Council represents the national governments and is responsible for coordinating policies that require unanimous or majority voting, while the European Parliament directly involves EU citizens in decision-making processes through elections held every five years wherein their representatives are elected by universal suffrage. Collectively they form a critical part of what's known as ""Ordinary Legislative Procedure"", which provides democratic legitimacy to legislation passed at the supranational level and enacted across all EU Member States, making it one of Europe’s largest directly elected bodies.

The Council is not a simple body its composition varies depending on what's being discussed – Foreign Affairs Ministers for instance or Transport ministers etc. It meets in various configurations representing different policy areas and usually takes decisions based upon qualified majority voting, which means countries can cast votes according to their population size while also considering the proportion of Member States supporting a proposal (usually 55% of member states with at least 65% total EU citizen support for an act).

Together these two bodies represent one pillar in establishing democratic legitimacy within European Union's legislative process, though it is important to recognize that the system has drawn criticism and sparked debates about its complexity.
