Evaluation Criteria as generated by GPT-4o:
During the evaluation, I weighted accuracy, completeness, and relevance based on the following considerations:

Accuracy (50%): This was the most heavily weighted factor, as it is crucial that the information provided in Answer B is factually correct and aligns with the reference Answer A. Inaccurate information significantly impacts the overall quality of the response.

Completeness (30%): This factor considered whether Answer B provided a full response that covered all key points mentioned in Answer A. Completeness ensures that no important details are omitted and that the answer can stand alone as a comprehensive response to the question.

Relevance (20%): This factor assessed how closely Answer B stayed on topic and addressed the specific question being asked. Even if the information is accurate and complete, it needs to be directly relevant to the question to be considered high quality.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown of how these factors were applied:

Accuracy: Each answer was checked for factual correctness. Major inaccuracies led to lower scores regardless of completeness and relevance because they can mislead the reader.
Completeness: Answers were evaluated on whether they provided all necessary information that was present in Answer A. If significant points were missing, the score was reduced even if the given information was accurate.
Relevance: Even if an answer contained accurate and complete information, it needed to be pertinent to the question. Irrelevant details or tangential information lowered the relevance score.
