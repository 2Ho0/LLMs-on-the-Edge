14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;"A fascinating question!

Ctenophora (also known as comb jellies or sea walnuts) are a class of marine animals that belong to the phylum Cnidaria, which also includes corals, sea anemones, and jellyfish.

Ctenophores are characterized by their unique body structure, which consists of a gelatinous umbrella-shaped bell with eight long, thin tentacles (cteneae) that hang down from it. These tentacles are covered in tiny, hair-like structures called cilia, which they use to capture small prey, such as zooplankton and fish larvae.

Some key features of ctenophores include:

1. Simple, non-stinging body: Unlike jellyfish, ctenophores do not have a stinging apparatus (nematocyst) in their tentacles.
2. Comb-like structure: The cilia on the ctenophore's tentacles create a ""comb"" effect when they beat together, helping to capture prey.
3. Swimming behavior: Ctenophores are able to swim by contracting and relaxing their bell-shaped body.

There are about 100 species of ctenophores, ranging in size from a few millimeters to over 30 centimeters (12 inches) in length. They are found in oceans worldwide, typically dwelling near the surface or in shallow waters. Some species can be bioluminescent, emitting a soft glow to help attract prey or communicate with other ctenophores.

While ctenophores may not be as well-known as jellyfish or corals, they play an important role in the marine ecosystem and are an interesting group of animals to learn about!";0.001158112;192.679505014;5.404065;187.141359;341;9;9

18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;"Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, also known as the three laws of motion, were first published in 1687 in his groundbreaking work ""Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica"" (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy). These laws revolutionized our understanding of the natural world and had a profound impact on the development of modern physics.

It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how long it took for scientists to improve upon Newton's laws, as they have been refined and modified over time through the work of many researchers. However, here are some key milestones that demonstrate the evolution of our understanding:

1. **Early refinements**: In the early 18th century, mathematicians like Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange began to develop new mathematical tools and techniques to apply Newton's laws to more complex systems.
2. **Hamiltonian mechanics** (1830s): William Rowan Hamilton introduced the concept of Hamiltonian mechanics, which provided a more powerful framework for understanding the behavior of physical systems. This led to significant improvements in our understanding of dynamics and the development of new mathematical techniques.
3. **Ergodic theory** (1900s): The work of mathematicians like Georg Cantor, Henri Poincaré, and Ludwig Boltzmann laid the foundation for ergodic theory, which studies the long-term behavior of physical systems. This led to a deeper understanding of the statistical properties of physical phenomena.
4. **Quantum mechanics** (1920s): The development of quantum mechanics by scientists like Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Werner Heisenberg introduced new principles and mathematical tools that challenged classical notions of motion. Quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.
5. **Relativity** (1910s): Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915) fundamentally changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity. These theories introduced new concepts like spacetime, curvature, and black holes, which have had a profound impact on modern physics.
6. **Modern refinements**: In the 20th century, scientists continued to refine and modify Newton's laws using advances in computer simulations, numerical methods, and theoretical frameworks. This led to significant improvements in our understanding of complex systems, chaos theory, and non-linear dynamics.

In summary, while it's difficult to pinpoint an exact timeline for improving upon Newton's laws, the development of new mathematical techniques, physical theories, and computational tools has continually refined our understanding of motion over the past three centuries.";0.001169131;301.362994822;9.082578;292.147735;528;17;4

23;When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?;October 1973;"The 1973 oil crisis, also known as the ""Oil Shock"" or ""First Oil Shock,"" began on October 17, 1973. On that day, Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel, known as the Yom Kippur War. This war led to an immediate increase in global demand for oil, as Arab countries imposed an oil embargo on the United States and other Western nations that supported Israel.

The embargo was part of a broader set of economic sanctions designed to punish the West for its support of Israel. The embargo was not formalized until November 1973, when the Organization of Arab Exporting Countries (OAPEC) announced that it would cut oil production by 25% and limit exports to countries supporting Israel.

The combination of increased demand due to the Yom Kippur War and the subsequent oil embargo led to a sharp rise in oil prices. The price of crude oil nearly tripled between October 1973 and March 1974, from around $3 per barrel to over $11 per barrel.

24;When were the Normans in Normandy?;10th and 11th centuries;"The Normans, a Germanic tribe, settled in Normandy (Nordmannia) during the 9th and 10th centuries. The name ""Normandy"" comes from the Old French word ""Normandie,"" which is derived from the Latin phrase ""Nortmannia,"" meaning ""land of the Northmen.""

The Viking invasions of England, France, and other parts of Europe had a significant impact on the region now known as Normandy. The Vikings, who were also known as the Danes or Norsemen, established settlements and trading posts along the coastlines of Francia (modern-day France) in the 9th century.

The Carolingian Empire, which was the dominant power in Western Europe during this period, struggled to control the region. In the early 10th century, the Viking leader Rollo, also known as Roubaud or Hrolf, established a settlement in the area and became the first Count of Normandy (911-927). This marked the beginning of the Norman dynasty.

Over time, the Normans developed their own culture, language, and identity. They adopted Christianity and the Latin language, which had been introduced by the Carolingian Church. The Normans also developed a distinct feudal system and became known for their military prowess, administrative skills, and cultural achievements.

The Norman Conquest of England in 1066, led by William the Conqueror (1028-1087), marked the peak of Norman power and influence. However, the Normans continued to rule Normandy until the 13th century, when it became a French province.

In summary:

* The Vikings settled in Normandy during the 9th century.
* Rollo established the first Norman settlement around 911-927 CE.
* The Normans developed their own culture and identity over several centuries.
* The Norman Conquest of England occurred in 1066, marking the peak of Norman power.

27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;"The Black Death, also known as the Plague, is believed to have originated in Central Asia, specifically in what is now Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact location of its origin is still debated among historians and scientists.

One theory suggests that the plague was caused by a bacterium called Yersinia pestis, which was transmitted from rodents to humans through the bites of infected fleas. This theory proposes that the plague emerged in the steppes of Central Asia, where it had been present for thousands of years before spreading to other parts of the world.

There are several lines of evidence supporting this theory:

1. The presence of Yersinia pestis bacteria has been detected in the remains of ancient humans and animals from the Caspian region.
2. The plague is known to have affected humans and animals in Central Asia for thousands of years before spreading to other parts of the world.
3. The timing of the pandemic's spread matches the known trade routes and migration patterns between Central Asia and Europe during the Middle Ages.

The most widely accepted theory is that the plague was transmitted from Central Asia to Europe through the Silk Road, a network of trade routes that connected China with the Mediterranean region. Merchants, traders, and travelers who had contact with infected rodents or fleas in Central Asia may have brought the disease to other parts of the world.

The pandemic spread rapidly throughout Europe, causing widespread illness and death. It's estimated that the plague killed between 75 million and 200 million people, approximately 30-60% of Europe's population, during the 14th century.

It's worth noting that while the Black Death is often associated with the plague, it's possible that other factors may have contributed to its rapid spread. These could include changes in climate, agricultural practices, or social and economic conditions that made populations more vulnerable to disease.";0.001113446;209.88787;4.963493;204.787586;373;8;6
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching;"Paul Baran, a French entrepreneur and inventor, developed the first practical electric razor in 1928. He founded the company Bara's, which later became part of Gillette, another well-known manufacturer of shaving products.

Baran's innovative design featured an electric motor that vibrated at high frequency to cut hair close to the skin, providing a closer shave than traditional wet shaving methods. His invention was a major breakthrough in personal grooming and paved the way for modern electric razors.

29;When was the French and Indian War?;1754?1763;"The French and Indian War, also known as the Seven Years' War in Europe, took place from 1754 to 1763. It was a global conflict that involved many European powers, including Britain, France, Spain, and Prussia.

In North America, the war began in 1754 with the Battle of Fort Necessity, when British forces led by General Edward Braddock were defeated by a combined force of French and Native American troops. The war continued until the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763, ending the conflict and marking the beginning of British dominance in North America.

Some key events during the French and Indian War include:

* The Battle of Fort Duquesne (1755): A British force led by General John Forbes captured the fort from the French.
* The Battle of Louisbourg (1758): British forces under General Jeffrey Amherst captured the French fortress on Cape Breton Island, which controlled access to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
* The Battle of Quebec (1759): British forces led by General James Wolfe defeated a larger French force led by General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, capturing the city and marking a turning point in the war.

The Treaty of Paris ended the war and marked the beginning of British dominance in North America. It also led to the Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited American colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains, leading to growing tensions between the colonies and Great Britain.";0.001222539;168.723149832;5.388624;163.200427;298;8;5
30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;"The agents that the immune system detects and responds to are called antigens. Antigens are substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, or other molecules, that can trigger an immune response when they enter the body.

Antigens can come from various sources, including:

1. Bacteria: The cell walls of bacteria contain antigens that stimulate an immune response.
2. Viruses: Viruses have antigens on their surface that can trigger an immune response.
3. Fungi: Some fungi, such as yeast, can elicit an immune response due to the presence of antigens.
4. Parasites: Antigens from parasites, like worms or protozoa, can stimulate an immune response.
5. Self-antigens: In some cases, the immune system may mistakenly recognize and respond to self-antigens, which are substances produced by the body's own cells.

The immune system uses various mechanisms to detect antigens, including:

1. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs): PRRs are proteins that recognize specific patterns on pathogens, such as bacterial cell walls or viral RNA.
2. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs): APCs, like dendritic cells and macrophages, engulf and process antigens, then present them to T-cells for recognition.

The immune system's response to antigens involves various mechanisms, including the activation of T-cells, B-cells, and other immune cells, which work together to eliminate or neutralize the antigenic threat.";0.001193575;174.461384941;6.659909;167.66936;306;12;2
31;What branch of theoretical computer science deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship?;Computational complexity theory;"The branch of theoretical computer science that deals with broadly classifying computational problems by difficulty and class of relationship is **Complexity Theory**, also known as **Computational Complexity Theory**.

In particular, complexity theory focuses on:

1. **Classifying problems based on their computational resources required**: This includes measures such as time (Turing machines), space (RAM), or both (trade-offs).
2. **Understanding the relationships between different problems**: This involves identifying whether two problems are equivalent, reducible to each other, or have different complexities.

Some key concepts in complexity theory include:

* Time and space complexity classes (e.g., P, NP, EXP)
* Reductions (e.g., polynomial-time many-one reduction, Turing reduction)
* Problems with varying degrees of difficulty (e.g., decision problems, optimization problems)

Understanding the complexity landscape helps computer scientists design efficient algorithms, prove lower bounds on computational power, and identify potential weaknesses in cryptographic systems.";0.001171533;115.043496406;9.898339;105.012356;193;21;4

The Latin term ""imperium"" means ""power"", ""authority"", or ""dominion"". From this root, the French term ""impérialisme"" was derived, and later the English term ""imperialism"" emerged.

In the 19th century, German philosopher Friedrich Schiller used the term ""Imperialismus"" to describe the expansion of European powers in Asia and Africa. The term gained wider usage in the early 20th century as anti-colonial movements emerged, seeking to challenge the dominance of European powers over non-European territories.

So, while Latin is the ancient language that gave rise to the concept of ""imperialism"", the modern English word itself has roots in French and German languages.";0.001161418;95.459872167;7.510521;87.817926;162;14;1
38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP);"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988.

At that time, the two organizations were concerned about the growing evidence of human-induced climate change and the need for a coordinated international response to address this issue. They decided to create an intergovernmental body to assess the scientific, technical, and socio-economic aspects of climate change, as well as its impacts on natural ecosystems and human societies.

The IPCC was officially established by UNEP and WMO in 1988, with a mandate to provide regular assessments of the state of knowledge on climate change. The first assessment report was published in 1990, and since then, the IPCC has produced several reports every few years, including the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) in 2007, the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2013/14, and the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR15) in 2018.

42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;"European Union (EU) law, also known as EU law or Community law, refers to the legal system that governs the European Union. It is a unique and complex legal framework that aims to harmonize laws across the 28 member states of the EU.

The EU has its own legal order, which is distinct from the national laws of its member states. EU law is based on a set of treaties, primarily the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as well as secondary legislation, such as regulations, directives, decisions, and opinions.

The primary sources of EU law are:

1. Treaties: The founding treaties, such as the TEU and TFEU, establish the basic principles and institutions of the EU.
2. Secondary legislation: Regulations, directives, decisions, and opinions issued by EU institutions, such as the European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and European Commission.

EU law governs a wide range of areas, including:

1. Internal market: Free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within the EU.
2. Competition: Regulation of anti-competitive practices, mergers, and state aid.
3. Consumer protection: Protection of consumers' rights and interests.
4. Environment: Conservation and protection of the environment, including climate change mitigation and adaptation.
5. Employment: Promotion of employment opportunities, social security, and workers' rights.
6. Justice and home affairs: Cooperation on justice, asylum, immigration, and border control issues.
7. Foreign policy: Common foreign and security policy, including cooperation on defense and crisis management.

The EU's legal system is characterized by:

1. Supremacy of EU law: EU law takes precedence over national laws in the event of conflict.
2. Direct effect: EU law can be directly applied by national courts, without the need for further implementation.
3. Primacy: EU law prevails over conflicting national and international laws.

EU law is enforced through a variety of mechanisms, including:

1. European Court of Justice (ECJ): The ECJ has the power to interpret EU law and ensure its uniform application across the member states.
2. National courts: National courts are responsible for applying EU law in their respective jurisdictions.
3. Enforcement agencies: Agencies such as the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) help enforce EU law.

Understanding EU law is essential for businesses, individuals, and governments operating within or interacting with the EU. It provides a framework for cooperation, regulation, and protection across the member states, promoting economic integration, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.";0.001166995;304.285950978;4.266088;299.888632;543;6;30
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of ""technē"" (τεχνη) to study simple machines. Technē referred to the skill or art of doing something, and was often used to describe the techniques and methods involved in creating and using tools and machines.

In ancient Greece, philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato discussed technē in the context of understanding how simple machines worked. For example, Aristotle's book ""Physica"" (Physics) contains a discussion of simple machines like the lever, pulley, and wheelbarrow, with the goal of understanding how they could be used to achieve specific effects.

The study of technē was seen as important for understanding not just the physical properties of machines, but also their role in human society. Philosophers like Aristotle believed that understanding technē was essential for developing a deeper appreciation for the natural world and for creating new technologies that would benefit humanity.

In this sense, the concept of technē provided a framework for philosophers to study simple machines as part of a broader inquiry into the nature of technology, culture, and human society.";0.001142034;126.094104306;7.045868;118.916847;218;13;4
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"Private schools and public schools are two different types of educational institutions, each with their own unique characteristics, advantages, and limitations. Here are some key differences in terms of rights:

**Right to autonomy**: Private schools have the right to autonomy in governing themselves, setting curricula, hiring teachers, and making decisions about admissions, curriculum, and student life. Public schools, on the other hand, are subject to government regulations, policies, and oversight.

**Right to select students**: Private schools can choose their students based on academic merit, socioeconomic status, religion, or other criteria, whereas public schools must accept all students who live within their boundaries, regardless of their background or abilities.

**Right to set tuition fees**: Private schools have the right to charge tuition fees to their students, which helps cover their operating costs. Public schools, by contrast, are funded through taxes and do not charge tuition fees.

**Right to manage finances**: Private schools have control over their financial resources, including budgeting, allocating funds, and making investment decisions. Public schools must follow government guidelines and regulations regarding budgeting and spending.

**Right to create own policies**: Private schools can establish their own policies, rules, and codes of conduct for students, teachers, and staff. Public schools must comply with state or national education standards, laws, and regulations.

**Right to define mission and values**: Private schools have the right to define their mission, values, and culture, which may be distinct from those of public schools. This allows private schools to prioritize specific goals, such as faith-based or socially conscious education.

**Right to participate in accreditation processes**: Private schools can choose to participate in accreditation processes that verify their academic quality and standards, whereas public schools are often subject to state-mandated evaluations and accountability measures.

**Right to respond to changing needs**: Private schools have the flexibility to adapt quickly to changing educational trends, community needs, or market demands. Public schools, while still responsive to community needs, may be slower to implement changes due to bureaucratic processes and government regulations.

In summary, private schools have more autonomy in governing themselves, selecting students, setting tuition fees, managing finances, creating their own policies, defining mission and values, participating in accreditation processes, and responding to changing needs. Public schools, on the other hand, are subject to government regulations, oversight, and accountability measures.";0.001454626;268.428536344;7.101155;261.193509;473;13;4
