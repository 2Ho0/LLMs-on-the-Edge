5;Along with geothermal and nuclear, what is a notable non-combustion heat source?;solar power;"A notable non-combustion heat source that complements geothermal and nuclear energy is solar thermal energy. Solar thermal technology harnesses the sun's energy to produce high-temperature heat for industrial processes or heating purposes without burning fuels. It uses concentrated sunlight, usually through mirrors, to generate steam that can drive turbines or provide direct heat transfer. This method is renewable and has a minimal environmental impact compared to fossil fuel-based energy sources.


Another non-combustion heat source worth mentioning is biomass energy in the form of biogas production. While burning biomass does produce combustion, its initial stage involves anaerobic digestion which can be seen as a prelude to combustion rather than actual combustion itself. However, it's cleaner and renewable compared to traditional fossil fuels.


Lastly, waste heat recovery systems are not inherently generating new heat but capture existing thermal energy that would otherwise dissipate into the environment. This can include heat from industrial processes or even natural sources such as ocean water or ambient air temperature gradients. While not a primary generation method, it is an innovative way to utilize non-combustion heat sources effectively.";0.001159331;84.004047069;5.246731;78.624255;272;18;2
6;What theorem defines the main role of primes in number theory?;The fundamental theorem of arithmetic;"The fundamental theorem that highlights the central role of prime numbers in number theory is known as **Fermat's Little Theorem**. However, a more comprehensive statement involving primes is found within **the Prime Number Theorem (PNT)**. The PNT describes how the prime numbers are distributed among the integers and gives an asymptotic formulation for the density of primes around large numbers.


Another significant theorem that illustrates the importance of primes in number theory is **Dirichlet's Theorem on arithmetic progressions**, which guarantees infinitely many primes in any sequence where the first term and the common difference are coprime (i.e., share no prime factors). This highlights the distribution of primes within certain patterns that do not have a simple closed form but still emphasizes their essential role in number theory.


It's important to note that Fermat's Little Theorem itself, which states that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \) (mod \( p \)), serves as the basis for many important results in number theory but doesn’t define primes' main role explicitly.

18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;" The improvement upon Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion has been a continuous process spanning several centuries. It is challenging to pinpoint an exact duration because progress in physics, including the refinement and extension of Newtonian mechanics, typically builds on existing knowledge incrementally over time. Key developments that extended or built upon Newton’s work include:


1. **Late 18th-century** - Joseph Louis Lagrange introduced Lagrangian mechanics in his ""Mécanique Analytique"" (1788), which simplified the equations of motion for complex systems and expanded on Newton's laws through a different formulation.


2. **Early 19th-century** - Pierre-Simon Laplace further developed these ideas in his ""Mécanique Céleste"" (1796), which addressed celestial mechanics, including the motion of planets and their perturbations beyond Newtonian scope.


3. **Late 19th century** - James Clerk Maxwell formulated classical electromagnetism in his ""A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism"" (1873), which, while not a direct improvement of Newton's laws per se, contributed to the broader understanding of physical laws.


4. **Early 20th century** - Albert Einstein revolutionized physics with his theory of special relativity in ""On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"" (1905) and general relativity in ""The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity"" (1916). These theories adjusted Newtonian mechanics for very high speeds, close gravitational fields, and large masses.


5. **Mid-20th century** - Quantum mechanics began to emerge as a necessary theory alongside classical physics, with significant contributions from scientists like Werner Heisenberg (1925) with the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics and Erwin Schrödinger (1926) with his wave equation.


The improvements are ongoing in modern times through advancements such as string theory and quantum gravity, but they remain speculative or theoretical at this stage without experimental confirmation. The process has not been linear rather it is a complex tapestry of theories that build upon each other over time.";0.001232683;157.150311393;4.256121;152.759833;512;17;4

38;What UN organizations established the IPCC?;the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was not established by a specific United Nations organization but is an entity of two UN bodies. It was created by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). These organizations collaborated to set up the IPCC in 1988, with the mandate to provide comprehensive assessments on climate change science, impacts, and potential future risks.;0.00123708;30.319510819;2.430712;27.754947;101;9;19
39;Which gas makes up 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere?;Diatomic oxygen;"Nitrogen is the gas that makes up approximately 78% of the Earth's atmosphere, not 20.8%. However, argon accounts for about 0.934% of Earth's atmospheric composition and oxygen constitutes roughly 21%, so neither matches exactly with the stated 20.8%. If we were to consider a hypothetical gas making up 20.8% of Earth's atmosphere, it would significantly alter our understanding of atmospheric science as currently known.


However, if you are asking for a gas that constitutes approximately 20-30% by volume in the Earth’s atmosphere under certain conditions or at specific locations (for instance, due to pollution), one might refer to carbon dioxide (CO2). Under those rare circumstances where CO2 concentration increases significantly, it could be around this range but even then, its percentage would fluctuate widely based on environmental factors and human activities.


For clarity, there's no standard atmospheric gas that naturally constitutes exactly 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere under typical conditions. The given figure is not representative of a stable component in our current understanding of earthly air composition.";0.001213209;81.668424732;4.502278;77.033865;267;15;3
40;What is the Yuan dynasty's official name?;the Great Yuan;" The official name of the Yuan dynasty, which was established by Kublai Khan in 1271 following his conquest of the Southern Song dynasty, is ""Dynasty of Fulfilled Contract"" (Chinese: 滥政大國). In Chinese historiography and some modern references, it's also referred to as the ""Yuan Dynasty,"" a name that was adopted internationally. The term ""Yuan"" itself means ""originating from"" or ""exceeding"" in Chinese, which is indicative of its Mongol origins under Genghis Khan and his successors.";0.001214561;41.009329412;3.246194;37.63203;135;11;4
41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens; The agents that the immune system detects and responds to are known as antigens. Antigens can be foreign substances such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, or any other potential threat to the body's health. Additionally, in some cases, non-infectious agents like pollen, transplanted tissues (which are seen by the immune system as foreign), and allergens can also serve as antigens that provoke an immune response.;0.00117269;33.256423994;3.051823;30.070479;109;11;2
42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;" European Union (EU) Law refers to the body of treaties, legislation, case law, and internal legal instruments that are binding on its member states. These laws come from two main sources: regulations and directives issued by EU institutions like the European Commission, Parliament, and Council and decisions directly applicable or enforceable in specific cases made by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).


Key aspects of European Union Law include:


- **Primacy of EU law**: EU law takes precedence over national laws of member states, meaning that if there is a conflict between an EU regulation or directive and national legislation, the latter must give way to the former.

- **Direct effect**: Certain provisions of European Union Law have direct effect within individual countries' legal systems without requiring national transposition into domestic law.

- **Preliminary ruling procedure**: National courts may refer questions concerning EU law to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling, which helps ensure uniform interpretation and application across all member states.

- **Supranational character**: The EU has its own legal system that operates above national laws in certain areas where it holds exclusive or shared competence with the states. This includes policy areas like trade, competition law, environmental protection, and human rights.

- **Legislative processes**: The creation of European Union Law typically involves extensive consultation, negotiation, and consensus among EU institutions and member states before a piece of legislation is adopted or enacted.


EU Law also covers areas such as competition law (to prevent anti-competitive practices), consumer protection, social policy, transportation, and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people within the internal market. It's a complex legal field that has significant influence on national laws and policies across Europe.";0.001211764;120.443752702;1.876961;118.432234;405;6;30
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;"In the ancient world, particularly during Classical Antiquity, philosophers studied simple machines through the lens of mechanics and physics. They utilized concepts such as lever (balance), inclined plane (slope), pulley (rotational motion), screw (twisting force), wedge (cutting or splitting action), and wheel and axle (rotational movement). These simple machines were examined to understand how they could amplify a single input force into a greater output force, an early form of exploring what we now term as ""mechanical advantage.""


Philosophers like Aristotle made substantial contributions by writing on the nature and function of these machines. In his work “Mechanica,” he discussed the principles behind simple machines and their use in construction and transportation, although not systematically or with modern scientific rigor. Later, thinkers such as Archimedes used mathematics to study levers and other simple machines more precisely, leading towards a foundational understanding of physics that would later be developed further during the Renaissance period by scientists like Galileo and Descartes.";0.001175004;70.428519437;3.712401;66.585808;233;13;4
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;"Private schools generally operate under different regulations than public schools and often enjoy several rights not afforded to their public counterparts. However, it's important to note that these rights can vary significantly depending on the country or region. Here are a few general rights private schools might have:

1. Autonomy in Governance: Private schools typically have more freedom in determining their governance structures and operational policies without adhering strictly to public school guidelines. For example, they may decide how to allocate funds, hire staff, or structure their curriculum.

2. Freedom of Curriculum Choices: Private schools usually have the right to choose the subjects and content taught in classrooms that differ from state-mandated public school curricula. They can often specialize in religious instruction (such as Catholic, Jewish, or Islamic studies) or offer unique educational approaches like Montessori, Waldorf, or classical education models.

3. Admission Policies: Private schools usually have the right to determine their admissions criteria independently of public school requirements, allowing them to prioritize certain demographics, preferences (such as applicants with special talents), religious affiliation, or other factors not typically considered in public school admission processes.

4. Tuition and Funding: Private schools do not receive government funding on the same scale as public schools instead, they rely primarily on tuition fees paid by families. This allows private institutions to be financially self-sustaining while also offering a wider range of pricing options based on parental ability to pay.

5. Religious Freedom: In many countries, particularly those with strong religious traditions or separation between church and state, private schools have the right to incorporate specific religious instruction as part of their curriculum or overall educational philosophy. Public schools must often adhere to a secular approach and not promote any particular religion.

6. Privacy: Private schools typically have more flexibility in how they handle students' personal information and privacy matters, such as maintaining confidential records or sharing student data. However, this should still be conducted within legal frameworks that protect student privacy rights.

It is crucial to note the specifics of these rights can vary greatly depending on local laws, regulations, and cultural norms in each country.";0.001172318;150.940189715;3.236781;147.573348;497;13;4
45;What is the largest stadium in Australia?;Melbourne Cricket Ground;The largest stadium by capacity in Australia is Adelaide Oval, which primarily serves as a cricket ground. However, if we consider all types of sports venues, Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) often rivals it due to its combined sporting event capacity. It's important to note that when considering 'stadium', one might also look at multipurpose arenas in such a case, the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium could be considered Australia's largest multipurpose stadium with a maximum seating capacity of approximately 100,000 people for events like AFL Grand Final. But purely by the name convention and primary use as a cricket venue, Adelaide Oval is notable.;0.001177947;45.526752853;2.428372;42.966128;154;8;3
46;Where do ctenophora live?;marine waters; Ctenophores, commonly known as comb jellies, are marine organisms that predominantly inhabit the ocean. They can be found in various sea environments ranging from the surface to deeper waters, but they most frequently occur in shallow coastal regions and continental shelves around the world. Some species have been discovered at significant depths, but overall, ctenophores are less common in deep-sea ecosystems compared to their prevalence in sunlit surface waters where zooplankton is abundant.;0.001242521;34.606741817;2.465336;32.010128;116;9;2

48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;"The two primary institutions that make up the European Union (EU) Parliament, which together form its main legislative body. Here is a brief overview of each:


1. The European Parliament: It is directly elected by EU voters every five years and represents citizens' interests across Europe. The Parliament has power to approve, amend, or reject EU legislation (acting as co-legislator with the Council), set policies through resolutions, elect the President of the European Commission, and supervise other EU institutions.


2. The Council of the European Union: Also known simply as ""the Council,"" it is composed of government ministers from each EU country, depending on the policy area to be discussed. It also acts as a legislative body where member states' representatives meet to adopt laws and coordinate policies.


Both institutions play significant roles in shaping EU law and ensuring that decisions reflect the interests of European citizens and their respective governments. They work together with other EU bodies, such as the European Commission (executive branch) and the European Court of Justice (judicial arm), to form a complex system of checks and balances within the EU's political structure.";0.001220818;77.728972381;4.062274;73.533204;256;15;9
49;The Scottish Parliament may legislate as it pleases as long as the powers aren't already reserved by where?;Westminster;"The Scottish Parliament can legislate on a wide range of issues, but its authority is subject to constraints set out in the Scotland Act 1998. The powers are not reserved for any other body if they do not fall within four specific areas: defense and foreign policy fiscal and economic affairs (including taxation) social security benefits and justice. Essentially, these reservations mean that while the Scottish Parliament has extensive legislative power, there are limits in areas where UK-wide coordination or uniformity is considered necessary for national interest.


For instance:

1. Defense - All matters relating to defense of the United Kingdom and its armed forces fall under reserved powers.

2. Foreign policy - The Scottish Parliament cannot legislate on international relations this power remains with the UK Government.

3. Fiscal and economic affairs - Although Scotland has control over many aspects such as income tax rates up to 90%, it is still subject to fiscal rules established by the UK Treasury, particularly concerning matters like VAT or National Insurance contributions.

4. Social security benefits - The administration of certain social security benefits remains a reserved matter, even though Scotland can set specific policies within these areas.

5. Justice - Although the Scottish Parliament has broad powers over devolved matters such as criminal law, it cannot legislate on justice and police matters in full without UK Government approval. However, there is significant overlap with responsibilities delegated to Scottish Ministers through Acts of Sovereign Competence.


In summary, the Scottish Parliament can make laws for Scotland unless they fall within those four specific reserved areas where powers are shared or exclusively held by the UK Parliament in Westminster.";0.001189298;112.739320724;5.435827;107.173223;366;23;1
