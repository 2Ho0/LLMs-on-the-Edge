3;An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?;rock crystallizes from melt (magma and/or lava); An igneous rock is a rock that forms when cooled and solidified from molten or semi-molten magma or lava. In other words, it is formed from the solidification of volcanic materials. This process can occur either at the Earth's surface or below ground level. As the magma cools down, various minerals crystallize out of it, forming distinct grains or crystals within the rock. Igneous rocks are further classified based on their texture, mineral composition, and the cooling rate of the magma from which they formed.;0.002035839;69.552039682;7.861976;61.554522;123;15;13

14;What is a ctenophora?;phylum of animals that live in marine waters;" Ctenophora, also known as comb jellies, are a phylum of mostly pelagic (open ocean-dwelling) invertebrates. They are characterized by their unique body shape and movement. The name ""Ctenophora"" comes from the Greek words ""ctenos,"" meaning ""comb,"" and ""phorein,"" meaning ""to bear.""

Ctenophorans have a relatively simple body plan, with a bell-shaped body that is flattened dorsoventrally (top and bottom). They lack a distinct head or tail, and their bodies are covered in rows of cilia called combs. These combs give them their name, as they create the appearance of a shimmering, iridescent ""comb"" effect when viewed from the side.

Ctenophorans feed mainly on plankton, including diatoms, other small organisms, and even smaller ctenophorans. They are able to change the direction of their cilia to move in different directions, allowing them to swim both forwards and backwards. Some species can also produce bioluminescence (produce light) for defense or communication purposes.

There are around 200 known species of Ctenophora, and they are found in all the world's oceans, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Despite their unique appearance and interesting behaviors, much remains unknown about these fascinating creatures.";0.001078429;150.457057302;4.943865;145.382643;309;9;9

17;By what means is imperialism usually administered?;colonization, use of military force, or other means;" Imperialism is the policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means over weaker countries or peoples. The administration of imperialism can take various forms depending on the specific historical context and the nature of the relationship between the dominant and dominated societies. Here are some common ways imperialism has been administered:

1. Direct Rule: This is when a colonizing power maintains total control over all aspects of the colony's government, economy, and society. The colonial power appoints its own administrators and governors, imposes its own legal system, collects taxes, and manages infrastructure.

2. Indirect Rule: In this system, the imperial power allows a native ruler or elites to maintain some semblance of political authority, but ultimately holds ultimate power over them. The imperial power may control important areas such as foreign relations, defense, and revenue collection.

3. Protectorate: A protectorate is a formal agreement whereby one sovereign state places itself under the protection of another. The protected state retains its internal autonomy but cedes control over specific external matters to the protecting power.

4. Economic Imperialism: In this form, a dominant power extends its influence through economic means such as trade, investment, or debt. This can lead to unequal trading relationships, dependency, and exploitation of weaker nations' resources.

5. Cultural Imperialism: This involves spreading the dominant culture, values, beliefs, art, and mass media of one society to another, often through education, media, and religious institutions. It can lead to the erosion of native cultures or their transformation under foreign influence.

6. Military Imperialism: A country may exert its power through military force or the threat of it. This can take various forms such as establishing military bases, occupying territories, or using military intervention to impose political change.

7. Political Imperialism: In this form, a dominant power may influence a weaker nation through political means such as diplomacy, alliances, or manipulation of international organizations. This can lead to unequal treaties, spheres of influence, and the imposition of political structures favorable to the dominant power.";0.001497481;229.833820678;5.779209;223.918199;473;9;11
18;How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?;nearly three hundred years;" Improvements and extensions to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion have been made continually since they were first published in the Principia (1687). The laws themselves are quite foundational to classical mechanics and have held up remarkably well over the centuries. However, there have been important refinements and additions, most notably Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity (1905) and general relativity (1915), which modified Newton's laws in certain situations involving high velocities or large masses.

It is difficult to assign a specific time frame to the improvements on Newton's laws as they have been an ongoing process over more than three centuries. The development of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century also introduced new challenges and limitations to Newton's laws, particularly in the microscopic realm.

So, while there have been significant advancements and refinements to Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion, it is not accurate to say that they were ""improved"" in a particular time frame. Instead, ongoing research and discoveries continue to expand our understanding of classical mechanics and its relationship to other areas of physics.";0.001078073;124.718673304;8.61889;115.967063;247;17;4
19;What aspects of life does Islamism seek to integrate itself into?;all spheres of life.;" Islamism is a political and religious ideology that seeks to instill Islamic principles and sharia law into various aspects of life. Some of the areas where Islamism aims to integrate itself are:

1. Politics: Islamism aspires to establish an Islamic state governed by sharia law, where the political system, institutions, and decision-making processes are based on Islamic principles. This may include the establishment of a caliphate or an Islamic council to govern the country.
2. Society: Islamism seeks to promote Islamic values, norms, and morals within society, which includes the way people live their daily lives. This may involve regulating personal behavior, such as dress codes, alcohol consumption, and sexual relations, as well as promoting communal living and social cohesion based on Islamic principles.
3. Economy: Islamism advocates for an economic system that is consistent with Islamic teachings, which may include prohibitions against usury (interest) and the promotion of economic activities that are beneficial to the community. This could lead to the establishment of an Islamic banking and finance system.
4. Education: Islamism seeks to promote Islamic education, both in formal schools and informal settings, to ensure that the younger generation is raised with a strong understanding of Islamic principles and values. This may also involve the promotion of Islamic sciences and scholarship.
5. Culture: Islamism advocates for the integration of Islamic art, literature, music, and other cultural expressions into daily life, as well as the preservation and promotion of Islamic heritage sites and monuments.
6. Justice: Islamism seeks to establish a justice system based on sharia law, which provides for the protection of individual rights, social harmony, and the common good. This may involve the establishment of Islamic courts or the integration of sharia law into existing legal systems.
7. Foreign policy: Islamism advocates for a foreign policy that is consistent with Islamic principles, such as the protection of Muslim communities abroad and the promotion of peace and cooperation between Muslim countries. This may also involve the rejection of Western influence and intervention in Muslim lands.";0.001076091;212.774468044;6.98797;205.655728;435;15;5

26;What are the main sources of primary law?;Treaties establishing the European Union;" Primary law refers to the foundational legal rules and principles that form the basis of a legal system. These rules and principles are typically created by the legislative or executive branches of government, rather than through interpretation by courts. Here are the main sources of primary law:

1. Constitutions: A constitution is the supreme law of a country, setting out the fundamental political principles, structure, and functioning of the government. It may also establish individual rights and freedoms.

2. Legislation: This includes acts, statutes, bills, and other forms of written law passed by a legislative body (such as Congress in the United States or Parliament in the United Kingdom). These laws apply to everyone within the jurisdiction of that legal system and may cover a wide range of topics, from criminal law to taxation.

3. Executive Orders: An executive order is a formal directive issued by the head of state or government (such as a president or monarch) to members of their administration or the military. Executive orders have the force of law and are used to implement policy, manage operations, or coordinate responses to emergencies.

4. Administrative Regulations: Administrative regulations are rules and guidelines created by executive agencies, departments, or other administrative bodies under the authority granted to them by legislation or executive orders. These regulations provide more specific details on how laws are enforced and applied in practice.

5. International Treaties: International treaties are agreements between two or more countries, which may be legally binding upon ratification by their respective governments. They can cover a wide range of subjects, including trade, human rights, and the environment. Once ratified, international treaties become part of a country's domestic law.

It is important to note that primary law may vary significantly between legal systems and jurisdictions. Additionally, primary law may be subject to interpretation by courts or other bodies, which can result in secondary law (such as case law or judicial decisions).";0.001073091;199.696350106;4.898761;194.667014;414;9;6
27;Where did the black death originate?;the arid plains of Central Asia;" The exact origin of the Black Death, which was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, is still a topic of debate among historians and scientists. The dominant theory is that it originated as a zoonotic disease, meaning it was transmitted from animals to humans, possibly through the bites of infected fleas.

The Black Death first appeared in Europe around 1347-1351 AD, but it's believed to have originated in Asia, likely in the area where China, Mongolia, and Russia meet today. This theory is based on various lines of evidence:

1. Historical records indicate that the Black Death first appeared in Europe from the east, along trade routes.
2. The disease was known as ""The Great Pestilence"" or ""The Bubonic Plague,"" which suggests an Eastern origin since ""pestilence"" is derived from the Latin word for ""Asia.""
3. Modern research has found that the Black Death bacterium, Yersinia pestis, exists in its most virulent form in Asia.
4. Molecular studies have shown that the DNA of modern strains of Y. pestis is closely related to those found in the remains of Black Death victims excavated in Europe and Asia.

However, it's important to note that these findings don't definitively prove where the Black Death originated they only provide strong evidence suggesting an Eastern origin. Other theories propose that the disease could have originated in Central Asia or even Europe itself. Ultimately, more research is needed to pinpoint the exact location of the Black Death's emergence with complete certainty.";0.001115721;174.500691838;4.889306;169.478329;356;8;6
28;What did Paul Baran develop?;Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching;" Paul Baran is credited with developing the concept of packet switching and the associated technology called the ""packet-switched computer network,"" which forms the basis for modern data communication networks such as the Internet. Packet switching breaks down data into smaller packets, sends each packet independently to its destination, and reassembles the packets in the correct order at the receiving end. This allows for more efficient use of network resources and enables real-time interaction between users on a network. Baran proposed this idea in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but it wasn't until the development of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) in the late 1960s that packet switching became a practical reality.";0.001821479;83.928557147;4.534664;79.255309;159;7;12

30;What are the agents the immune system detects known as?;pathogens;" The agents that the immune system detects are generally referred to as pathogens or antigens.

Pathogens are microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi, that can cause disease in organisms. The immune system detects pathogens through various mechanisms, including recognizing specific molecules on the surface of the pathogen (antigens) or sensing molecular signals released by the pathogen.

Antigens are specific molecules that can trigger an immune response. Antigens can be proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, or even nucleic acids. They can be found on the surface of pathogens, but they can also be found on the surface of our own cells under certain conditions, such as during infection or in cases of autoimmune diseases. The immune system recognizes antigens through specific receptors called antibodies and T-cell receptors.

So, in summary, the immune system detects pathogens (microorganisms) and their antigens (specific molecules on the surface of pathogens or other cells that can trigger an immune response).";0.001562812;131.76963975;6.57752;125.060187;249;12;2

35;Sophocles demonstrated civil disobedience in a play that was called?;Antigone;" I'm glad you asked about Sophocles and civil disobedience, but I must clarify that there is no definitive evidence that Sophocles, an ancient Greek playwright (around 496-406 BC), wrote a play specifically about civil disobedience as we understand the term today. The concept of intentionally breaking laws to bring attention to unjust laws or governments did not come into prominence until much later, during the time of figures like Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Sophocles' plays, such as ""Oedipus Rex,"" ""Antigone,"" and ""Philoctetes,"" dealt with themes of morality, ethics, and the human condition. In ""Antigone,"" there is a scene where Antigone disobeys Creon's order not to bury her brother Polyneices, but this is more about the conflict between individual morality and societal law than it is about civil disobedience as we understand it today.

So, while it's an interesting idea, there isn't a Sophocles play that can be definitively said to demonstrate civil disobedience.";0.001142664;143.114820857;8.176797;134.807528;268;12;2

37;The word imperialism has it's origins in which ancient language?;Latin;" The term ""imperialism"" does not have origins in any ancient language. The concept of imperialism, which refers to the policies and practices by which a powerful state extends its authority over weaker nations or peoples, emerged during the late 19th century. The word itself comes from the Latin word ""imperium,"" which means power or authority. However, the modern political and economic connotations of imperialism developed in the context of European colonial expansion during this period.";0.001276942;55.564159252;7.44788;47.985335;97;14;1

40;What is the Yuan dynasty's official name?;the Great Yuan;" The Yuan Dynasty, also known as the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, was officially established in China in 1271 with the founding of the Northern Song-led united front government under Mongol rule. The official names of this dynasty include:

1. Great Yuan (Da Yuan) or Great Mongol Empire (Da Mongol Qhuriltai): This was the original name given to the empire by the Mongols themselves, indicating its expansive territorial reach beyond China.
2. Great Ming of the Ten Thousand Sages (Han Wen Ming Dynasty or Da Ming Wen Sheng): This name was given during the late Yuan period when the Han Chinese tried to legitimize Mongol rule and present it as a continuation of the earlier Chinese Song Dynasty.

However, the most commonly used term for this dynasty in history is ""Yuan Dynasty"" (元朝), which was adopted during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and has been widely used since then. This term originates from the Chinese pronunciation of ""Yuan,"" meaning origin or beginning, reflecting the dynasty's status as the precursor to the Ming and later Qing dynasties.";0.001135665;148.526607495;6.546237;141.845652;282;11;4
41;What are the agents detected by the immune system called?;pathogens; The agents detected by the immune system are called antigens.

42;What is European Union Law?;a body of treaties and legislation, such as Regulations and Directives, which have direct effect or indirect effect on the laws of European Union member states;" European Union (EU) law refers to the body of laws, regulations, and case law that applies to the European Union and its member states. EU law takes precedence over national laws, meaning that in cases where there is a conflict between EU law and national law, EU law must be applied.

The main sources of EU law are:

1. The Treaties: These are the founding documents of the EU, which set out the principles, objectives, and institutions of the Union. The most important treaties include the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
2. Regulations: These are legally binding acts that apply directly to all member states and their citizens without the need for any further action by national authorities.
3. Directives: These are legislative acts that set out goals that member states must achieve, but leave it up to them to decide on how to do so.
4. Decisions: These are legally binding acts addressed to specific entities or member states.
5. Case law: This refers to the judgments and opinions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) in interpreting and applying EU law.

EU law covers a wide range of areas, including free movement of goods, services, capital, and people competition policy agriculture and fisheries environmental protection consumer protection justice and home affairs and many more. It is enforced by various institutions, including the European Commission, the Council of the European Union, the European Parliament, and the Court of Justice of the European Union.";0.00123035;176.217334842;3.707623;172.376728;342;6;30
43;What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?;the concept of force;" In ancient philosophy, the concept used to study simple machines was known as ""mechanics"" or ""techne mechanike,"" which can be translated as ""the art of moving things mechanically."" This branch of knowledge dealt with the study of tools, machines, and the principles behind their operation. The focus was on understanding how to apply physical forces in a controlled manner to achieve specific results, often through the use of simple machines such as levers, pulleys, inclined planes, wheels and axles, and wedges. This knowledge was important for various practical applications, including construction, agriculture, mining, and military engineering. Philosophers like Aristotle made significant contributions to this field by studying the principles behind the operation of these simple machines and developing classifications and explanations based on natural phenomena.";0.001684923;89.400871798;7.434906;81.834088;164;13;4
44;What right do private schools have that public schools don't?;to select their students;" Private schools have the right to determine their own governance, curriculum, and admissions policies. Here are some key differences between private and public schools in terms of rights:

1. Autonomy: Private schools are independently governed by a board of trustees or other governing body, which allows them more flexibility in making decisions about curriculum, faculty hiring, and other educational policies. Public schools, on the other hand, are overseen by local, state, or federal education agencies and must adhere to certain regulations and guidelines.

2. Tuition: Private schools charge tuition fees, allowing them to generate revenue and operate with a larger budget than public schools. This can result in smaller class sizes, more individualized attention for students, and access to additional resources like advanced technology or specialized facilities. Public schools are funded primarily through local, state, and federal taxes, which may limit their financial resources.

3. Admissions: Private schools have the right to select their students based on various criteria such as academic achievement, extracurricular activities, interviews, or even family connections. Public schools must accept all students within their district or catchment area, with some exceptions for special education needs or other extenuating circumstances.

4. Curriculum: Private schools may offer unique curricula that cater to specific educational philosophies, religious beliefs, or academic focus areas. Public schools must adhere to state-mandated curriculum guidelines, which may limit their flexibility in designing innovative programs or focusing on niche subjects.

5. Extracurricular activities: Private schools often offer a wide range of extracurricular activities, clubs, and sports teams that cater to diverse interests and help students develop well-rounded skills. Public schools may have limited resources for these activities due to budget constraints, making it challenging to provide a similar breadth of opportunities for all students.

6. Funding: Private schools rely on tuition fees, donations, grants, and endowments for funding, whereas public schools receive the majority of their funding from taxes. This can lead to differences in resources available to each type of school, with private schools often having more financial flexibility due to their diverse revenue streams.

7. Religious or Philosophical Affiliation: Private schools may have a religious or philosophical affiliation that shapes their educational approach and values, while public schools must remain neutral on such matters. This can result in private schools offering a unique educational experience that aligns with the beliefs and values of the school community.";0.001154146;271.400167773;6.507029;264.761997;521;13;4

48;What are the two bodies that make up the European Union's legislature?;European Parliament and the Council of the European Union;" The European Union (EU) has two main institutions that form its legislative branch: the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of the EU. While both institutions have a role in law-making, they differ in their composition and representation of EU member states.

1. European Parliament (EP): It is directly elected by the citizens of the EU member states. With 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) representing each EU country in proportion to its population, the EP represents the democratic voice of the EU citizens. The Parliament's main role includes approving or rejecting legislation proposed by the European Commission and electing the Commission President and other members of the European Commission.

2. Council of the EU: It is composed of government representatives from each EU member state. Each EU country has a permanent representative to the Council, who is usually a cabinet minister or a senior civil servant. The Council makes decisions through consensus, meaning that every member state has an equal say in legislation. It also plays a crucial role in appointing the European Commission President and other members of the Commission upon EP approval.

Together, these two institutions make up the legislative branch of the EU and collaborate to create and pass laws binding on all EU countries.";0.001405238;139.597784388;8.245758;131.220061;261;15;9
